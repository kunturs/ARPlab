Scared and malnourished - footage from Gaza shows plight of children and aftermath of Israeli strike,"The war's horrors multiply. The dead, the pieces of the dead. The dying. The starving. More and more of them now – all the weight of human suffering witnessed by my brave colleagues in Gaza.

The urge to avert our gaze can be overpowering. But the cameramen who work for the BBC cannot turn away, and on Tuesday one of them became a casualty himself. For their safety we do not reveal the names of our colleagues in Gaza.

Our cameraman was not seriously wounded, but that was a matter of luck. The Israeli bombs launched into the car park of the European Hospital in Khan Younis killed and wounded dozens.

The Israelis say the leader of Hamas was hiding in a command-and-control compound under the hospital. The army said it conducted a ""precise strike"" - and blamed Hamas for""cynically and cruelly exploiting the civilian population in and around the hospital"". Hamas denies such charges.

At the time of the attack, families whose sick children are to be evacuated from Gaza were gathering in the hospital. There were also families waiting to meet children returning from treatment abroad.

One of the fathers was with our BBC colleague and was wounded by the bombs. He has now been discharged from hospital. Harrowing images show our journalist trying to console the man's terrified children.

Warning: This report contains distressing images.

Much of my colleague's work in recent days has focused on the plight of malnourished children.

A short time before the blast, I messaged to thank him for his work filming, with immense sensitivity, the story of Siwar Ashour. This was his response:

""Siwar's story broke something in all of us, and working on it was one of the most painful things I've ever had to do. But I knew her face, her name, and her story had to be seen – had to be heard.""

Siwar is five months old and acutely malnourished, a child whose large, brown eyes dominate her shrunken frame. They follow her mother Najwa's every move. On Tuesday Najwa sent us a video message from her room at Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza.

She wanted the world to know how much she loves her child. ""I wish she could receive the treatment she needs, to recover fully, and return as she was before – to play like other children, to grow and gain weight like other children. She is my first child, and as her mother, I'm deeply heartbroken for her.""

In the past few days Siwar has developed a skin infection. Sores have appeared on her hands. She also has a severe gastrointestinal condition. The battle is to keep nourishment inside her. Her immune system is fighting the deprivation caused by the Israeli blockade.

The baby's cry is weak, yet it is full of urgency, the sound of a life struggling for its survival. Siwar can only drink a special milk formula due to severe allergies.

On Tuesday there was some better news. Medics at the nearby Jordanian Field Hospital managed to find some of the formula she needs. It is a small amount but they plan to send more.

In the coming days there are plans to bring sick children to the United Arab Emirates and Jordan. Here in Amman there are already several Gaza families who have children being treated for illness or war injuries in local hospitals. These evacuations are co-ordinated with the Israelis who do background checks on the parents travelling with their children.

In January we filmed the arrival of Abdelrahman al-Nashash and his mum Asma. Abdelrahman lost his leg in an Israeli bombing.

For four months they've lived in a place with food and shelter. A safe place.

When we visited them on Tuesday Asma called her children and their grandmother in Gaza.

Grandmother Najwa spoke of the war all around them. ""The rockets are everywhere, firing over our heads. The food. Life is very bad. There is no flour. The prices are very high.""

The children waved and blew kisses to their mother.

Afterwards, Asma told us: ""I don't know what to say. I am very grateful for my mum for all she is doing for me. I wish I can return back to find them safe and in good health."" She broke down and was silent.

It is only through the eyes of a mother who sees her children trapped, frightened and hungry from a safe distance, that it is possible to imagine why anyone would want to go back to Gaza.

Céline Dion sends message to Eurovision as favourites Sweden qualify,"Céline Dion made a rare appearance during the first semi-final of the Eurovision Song Contest with a brief, pre-recorded message.

The star won the contest for Switzerland in 1988, and it had been rumoured she would take the stage as the ceremony returns to the country this year.

""I'd love nothing more than to be with you,"" she said in a video, apparently ruling out that possibility. ""Switzerland will forever hold a special place in my heart. It's the country that believed in me and gave me the chance to be part of something so extraordinary.""

The semi-final saw 10 acts qualify for Saturday's grand finale, including Swedish entrants KAJ, whose song Bara Bada Bastu is the runaway favourite.

Their song, an accordion-led comedy number whose title translates to ""let's take a sauna"", has a 40% chance of winning, according to bookmakers.

If the prediction comes true, it would be Sweden's eighth Eurovision title - making them the most victorious country in the contest's history (they are currently tied with Ireland, on seven wins each).

Fifteen acts performed at Tuesday's semi-final in Basel's St Jakobshalle. These are the ones who made the cut.

That means that the Eurovision dreams of Azerbaijan, Belgium, Cyprus, Croatia and Slovenia have all ended for 2025.

Of those, the biggest surprise was Belgium's Red Sebastian, whose rave anthem Strobe Lights had been predicted to finish among the top five.

His disqualification came on the day of his 26th birthday.

Ten more acts will progress to the main competition after Thursday's second semi-final.

The ""Big Five"" countries, who contribute the most financially to the competition (France, Germany, Spain, the UK and Italy) qualify automatically, as do last year's winners, Switzerland.

Dion's video message came during the ceremony's interval, as votes were being cast.

Although she was unable to be there in person, it was a coup for organisers. The singer has stepped away from the limelight in recent years due to health issues related to stiff-person syndrome (SPS), a neurological condition that causes muscle spasms and makes it difficult for her to walk.

After a four-year break, she made an emotional comeback at last summer's Paris Olympics, singing Edith Piaf's classic Hymne à l'Amour from the Eiffel Tower.

Speculation over a potential Eurovision appearance has been mounting since Swiss singer Nemo won the 2024 contest.

In her video, Dion said it was ""beautiful and emotional"" to see the young singer lift the trophy, and recalled that her victory in 1988 ""was a life-changing moment for me"".

""To the people of Switzerland, thank you for your love,"" she continued. ""This night is yours and I hope you feel as proud as I do.""

After repeating her message in French, several former Eurovision contestants appeared on stage to cover Dion's winning song from 1988, Ne Partez Pas Sans Moi (Don't Leave Without Me).

However, organisers said they had not given up hope of the star appearing at the final this weekend.

""We are still in close contact with her,"" they said in a statement.

Tuesday's semi-final opened with Icelandic group VÆB, two brothers with the unregulated energy of former Irish entrants Jedward.

They were followed by Polish star Justyna Steczkowska, who hung precariously above the stage on two ropes, as she sang her witchy hymn to mother earth, Gaja.

The acrobatics continued with Slovenian musician Klemen, who was suspended upside down during his ballad How Much Time Do We Have Left?

The song was a tribute to his wife, who has recently recovered from cancer, but the emotional performance wasn't enough to clinch him a position in the final.

Taking a lighter note was Estonia's Tommy Cash, whose quirky anthem Espresso Macchiato was interrupted by a ""stage invader"" - actually a dancer who replicated his noodle-limbed dance moves.



The arena was awash with Ukranian flags for Ziferblat, whose prog-pop anthem Bird Of Pray is a message of hope and resilience to families separated by the country's ongoing war with Russia.

Italy's Lucio Corsi brought 70s glam rock vibes with his track Volevo Esse Un Duro, which even featured a visual call-back to David Bowie and Mick Ronson's iconic 1972  performance of Starman on Top Of The Pops.

Bosnian singer Marko Bošnjak was all black eyeliner and sinister energy for his kill-your-enemies anthem Poison Cake, while Dutch singer Claude took the opposite approach, brimming with positivity throughout his upbeat performance of C'est La Vie.

And Swiss singer Zoë Më was bathed in a sea of mobile phone lights as she performed Voyage , an understated and rather beautiful plea for kindness and understanding.

However, KAJ were the artists to beat - with the entire audience stomping along to their goofy sauna anthem (""Damn it, turn up the heat!"")

The song, performed in the Vörå dialect, is a radical departure from Sweden's tried and tested formula of slick pop anthems.

It was the surprise winner at the Melodifestivalen, the hotly-contested show that selects the country's Eurovision entry, and has gone on to top the Swedish pop charts for 11 weeks.

Speaking to the BBC, the band - who are actually from the Swedish-speaking part of Finland - said it was strange to enter the contest as the presumed favourite.

""We are feeling the pressure a bit,"" they admitted, ""but we're gonna go out there, have fun, bring the steam, bring the sauna culture, and we'll see how far it goes.""

Tearful Casandra Ventura tells court Diddy beat and humiliated her,"Sean ""Diddy"" Combs' ex-girlfriend, Casandra Ventura, has told the hip-hop mogul's sex-trafficking trial that he controlled her life and coerced her into ""humiliating"" sex acts.

The prosecution's star witness testified about the alleged physical and emotional abuse she endured at the hands of the rapper during so-called ""freak-offs"", or sexual encounters the couple had with male escorts.

Family and friends have come to court in large numbers to support Mr Combs, whose legal team has not yet questioned Ms Ventura.

Mr Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges including racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution.

Warning: This story contains details that some readers may find distressing.

Prosecutors began by questioning Ms Ventura - one of their two central witnesses in the case - about her 11-year, on-and-off relationship with Mr Combs.

Now 38 and pregnant with her third child, she met Mr Combs when she was a 19-year-old aspiring singer and he was 37.

His record label would later sign Ms Ventura as an artist, and shortly afterwards their romantic relationship began.

At the time, she testified, she felt like they were in a monogamous relationship, though she knows now that he had other girlfriends.

She said she ""fell in love"" with the ""larger-than-life entrepreneur and musician"". But it was not long before she noticed another side to him, she said.

Mr Combs wanted to ""control"" her life, Ms Ventura said. She said he paid for her home, her cars, her phone and other technology that he would sometimes take away to ""punish"" her.

""Control was everything, from the way that I looked... to what I was working on,"" Ms Ventura said.

Eventually, she claimed, the control turned violent. Mr Combs would ""bash on my head, knock me over, drag me and kick me"" frequently, Ms Ventura testified, sometimes through tears.

She alleged that she was left with swollen lips, black eyes and knots on her forehead.

Prosecutors spent hours on Tuesday asking Ms Ventura about so-called ""freak-offs"".

Ms Ventura told the court how Mr Combs introduced her to the sexual events  during the first year of their relationship. They would hire a male escort or stripper to have sex with Ms Ventura while Mr Combs watched.

Ms Ventura told the court that she first tried the encounters to make Mr Combs ""happy"". But she said they humiliated her, and sometimes lasted three to four days.

""I felt pretty horrible about myself,"" she told the court, wiping away tears. ""It made me feel worthless.""

Ms Ventura told the court she never wanted to have sex with anyone but Mr Combs, and claimed she would take myriad drugs - marijuana, ecstasy and ketamine - to help her perform to Mr Combs' satisfaction, but also to ""disassociate"".

The drugs were ""a way to not feel it for what it really was"", she said, ""having sex with a stranger I didn't really want to be having sex with"".

As prosecutors pressed Ms Ventura about the ""freak-offs"", she told the court of how Mr Combs would direct her to find male escorts, strippers or dancers to have sex with while he watched.

She alleged that Mr Combs would pay the men anywhere from $1,500 to $6,000 in cash, depending on their performance.

They found the men through stripper companies and sites like Craigslist. Some of their photos were displayed to the jurors, including Daniel Phillip, who finished his testimony earlier on Tuesday.

Ms Ventura and Mr Combs had the enounters in cities around the world, including Los Angeles, New York, Las Vegas and Ibiza, Spain, Ms Ventura testified.

Sometimes, men would be flown in during vacations, she alleged, and Mr Combs would direct her to ask staff to pay for and arrange their travel, calling them new employees.

Among other charges, prosecutors are trying to prove that Mr Combs engaged in sex trafficking - human trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation - and transportation to engage in prostitution.

As prosecutors pressed Ms Ventura for graphic details, one key element emerged: Ms Ventura claimed that Mr Combs controlled every part of the encounters.

He chose the outfits she wore - down to the extremely high heels she kept on for hours - as well as the sexual acts that transpired and the lighting, Ms Ventura told jurors.

""If Sean wanted something to happen, that was what was going to happen,"" she said. ""I couldn't say no.""

Sometimes, Ms Ventura said, she would take the lead on which male escorts to hire because Mr Combs was ""very busy"", but she only did so at his direction, she said.

She said freak-offs had a very specific ""pattern"" of sexual acts each time.

""He was controlling the whole situation,"" she alleged. ""He was directing it.""

At times, Ms Ventura said, she tried to tell Mr Combs that she felt ""horrible"". But when he dismissed her concerns, she said, she relented, worried he would get angry  or question their relationship.

Ms Ventura is expected to continue her testimony on Wednesday, when she could also face cross-examination.

Cryptocurrency boss's daughter escapes kidnap gang in Paris street,"A masked gang have tried to abduct the daughter and young grandson of a cryptocurrency chief in Paris, but after a violent struggle they drove off empty-handed.

The botched kidnap bid was captured on video by an onlooker in Paris's 11th district, in the east of the French capital.

Police sources said the woman was the daughter of a cryptocurrency company boss. She and her husband fought off three attackers until passers-by rushed to their aid and the men fled in a van.

A Paris police brigade that tackles armed robbery is expected to investigate the attack, which is the latest in a series of abductions targeting French cryptocurrency figures or their relatives.

The attack unfolded at about 08:20 local time on Tuesday, according to local media, when three men leapt from a white van and tried to kidnap the mother and her child.

The pair are described as relatives of the co-founder of French Bitcoin exchange platform Paymium, the AFP news agency said.

The woman's husband who was with his family at the time tried to protect them and was beaten repeatedly over the head. The couple shouted for help as the masked men tried to pull them apart.

At one point she was seen to grab a firearm off the attacker and throw it into the street. The weapon was later described as a replica air gun.

The street was relatively busy at the time and a group of children were on their way to a local primary school.

Initially, passers-by appeared too afraid to intervene, but as locals began to react the three attackers eventually gave up and jumped into the van as a fourth gang member drove them away. One man hurled a fire extinguisher at the van as it sped off.

The family were treated for minor injuries in hospital.

The botched kidnapping in the Rue Pache came little more than a week after French police rescued the father of a cryptocurrency millionaire who had been kidnapped in another area of the capital while walking his dog and held for ransom.

In an indication of the brutality of the gangs involved, the victim was freed three days later after his kidnappers had cut off one of his fingers.

Several people were arrested.

Last January, David Balland, co-founder of cryptocurrency wallet firm Ledger, was abducted with his wife at their home in central France.

French media say the victim had one finger missing when he was rescued from a house in Palaiseau, south of Paris.",2025-05-14T08:58:15Z
Judge cuts Menendez brothers' sentences giving them chance of parole,"A Los Angeles judge has reduced the sentence of Erik and Lyle Menendez, who are serving life in prison for the 1989 murders of their parents in a Beverly Hills mansion, making them eligible for parole.

Judge Michael Jesic resentenced the brothers to 50 years to life. A decision on their potential release must next be made by the state parole board, which will hold a hearing in the case next month.

The district attorney had argued vehemently against a lower sentence, saying the brothers were not rehabilitated. The Menendezes claimed they killed Kitty and Jose Menendez out of self-defence after years of sexual abuse.

The case, which has prompted books and documentaries, still divides many Americans.

After the judge agreed to resentence them on Tuesday afternoon, the brothers delivered an emotional statement to the court.

They went through grim details of the brutal killings and their decision to reload their shotguns and keep shooting their parents at point-blank range in the living room of their home. The siblings were aged 18 and 21 at the time.

""I had to stop being selfish and immature to really understand what my parents went though in those last moments,"" Erik Menendez, 54, told the court.

He described the ""shock, confusion and betrayal"" they must have felt seeing their sons holding guns and opening fire.

Both apologised for their actions and talked about their hopes of working with sex abuse victims and helping those incarcerated if they were given a second chance outside prison.

The voice of Lyle Menendez, 57, cracked as he talked about the impact of his ""unfathomable"" actions on their relatives.

""I lied to you and forced you into a spotlight of public humiliation,"" he said to his family.

Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman said the decision to resentence the pair was ""monumental"" and carried ""significant implications for the families involved"".

Much of the hearing centred on what the brothers have been doing in prison for the last 30 years.

Family members and those who worked with them in prison detailed the educational courses they completed and programmes they created to improve the lives of inmates, including a hospice initiative for the elderly and sick.

Judge Jesic called the brothers' work while in prison ""remarkable"", but noted that their 1996 sentences to life without parole were justified at the time.

He said under the guidelines, they were eligible for resentencing, issuing his new sentence of 50 years to life. The brothers have been held in custody since 1990.

As the judge continued reading, the brothers smiled and waved to their attorneys and family members who crowded into the courtroom. Family members embraced with smiles.

""Today is a great day,"" defence lawyer Mark Geragos told reporters outside court. He said they were ""one huge step closer to bringing the boys home"".

Anamaria Baralt, the brothers' cousin who testified inside court earlier in the day, said their family was elated.

""It is a difficult process,"" she said of the parole hearing that awaits the brothers, but noted they will ""eagerly step through those doors if it means we can have them home"".

Inside court earlier, relatives pleaded with the judge to allow the siblings' release.

Ms Baralt, who said she has been close with them since they were children, told the judge they deserved a ""second chance at life"".

""It's been a nightmare,"" she said. ""I am desperate for this process to be over.""

Ms Baralt told the court she speaks with the brothers frequently and testified that they had taken ""ownership of their actions"".

She said Lyle Menendez had acknowledged to her he had asked a witness to lie when testifying at their previous trial.

But she added: ""They are very different men from the boys they were.""

The judge also heard from a retired Florida judge - who said he has never testified on behalf of any criminal defendant - and Anerae ""X-Raided"" Brown, a rapper who was in prison with both brothers and credits their help for his release.

The district attorney's office, which fiercely opposes the brothers being released, questioned each witness about Erik and Lyle Menendez's ""litany of lies"" they have clung to since the murders.

Prosecutors said they lied to law enforcement immediately after the crimes, lied to family members about their guilt and gave false evidence at their trials.

Prosecutors have said the brothers have continued to ""make excuses"" for their conduct instead of taking full responsibility.

""There's no doubt they've done all these positive things in prison,"" Deputy District Attorney Habib Balian said in his closing argument.

But, he added, when reversing a jury's unanimous verdict in such a brutal murder case, it's important to ""make certain they are truly rehabilitated"".

The case was thrust back into the spotlight after a new Netflix drama, Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story, as well as the release of docudrama, The Menendez Brothers.

It introduced the case to a new generation and garnered attention from celebrities - including Kim Kardashian and Rosie O'Donnell - who called for the brothers to be released. The previous district attorney, George Gascón, backed their resentencing bid, allowing the effort to go before a judge.

The next step for the brothers will be the California parole board.

The board has already been vetting the siblings after a request by Governor Gavin Newsom. The governor is separately weighing a request from the brothers for clemency, which could take the form of a reduced sentence or a pardon - if approved.

A risk assessment has been completed on the brothers as part of their request for clemency. The district attorney said it indicated a ""moderate risk of violence"". However, the full report has not been released.

Newsom asked the parole board to conduct a risk assessment, which has already been drafted, that examines whether they pose a risk to the general public if released.

The state's parole board is set to conduct a separate hearing on 13 June for the brothers.

It's unclear what could come at the hearing, or if there might be multiple hearings vetting their potential release.",2025-05-14T08:58:15Z
'Go back to Ukraine': War refugees complain of abuse in Poland,"Svitlana says her daughter loved her school in Poland.

""Even when we moved to another area, she didn't want to change schools,"" says the 31-year-old Ukrainian mother. ""She liked it so much. There was no bullying.""

Now she says the atmosphere at the school – and in Poland overall – has changed.

""Two weeks ago, she came home and said ""One boy said to me today, 'Go back to Ukraine'."" Svitlana was astonished.

She is one of dozens of Ukrainians living in Poland who have told the BBC that anti-Ukrainian sentiment has risen considerably in recent months.

Many described experiencing abuse on public transport, bullying in schools and xenophobic material online.

A polarising presidential election campaign has added to the tension, with the first round of voting taking place on Sunday.

The day after Svitlana's daughter was told to go back to Ukraine, the abuse became even worse.

""Girls from the class above started complaining about her speaking Ukrainian. Then they pretended to fall to the ground shouting 'Missile! Get down!' and laughing,"" Svitlana says. ""She came home crying.""

A Russian missile had slammed into Svitlana's hometown in Ukraine days before, killing scores of civilians, including children. Her daughter was traumatised.

Svitlana – not her real name  did not want to be identified as she fears reprisals. She showed us screenshots of messages with school staff where she complains about her daughter's treatment.

She said she had noticed attitudes changing towards Ukrainians in other places, too: ""At work, many people have been saying Ukrainians come here and behave badly. And my Ukrainian friends say they want to go home because Polish people don't accept us. It's frightening to live here now.""

According to government statistics, at least 2.5 million Ukrainians live in Poland, comprising almost 7% of the total population of Poland.

When the full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022, there was an outpouring of compassion from Poles. ""It was amazing. Every day people were calling, asking, 'How can we help?'"" says activist Natalia Panchenko, head of the Warsaw-based 'Stand with Ukraine' Foundation.

""Some of them organised humanitarian convoys or brought refugees here. They gave their houses, food, everything they have – and their hearts, too.""

Three years later, Natalia says she believes the majority of Poles still support Ukraine. But some don't – and her organisation has noticed an upsurge of anti-Ukrainian online abuse that began several months ago.

""Then it started to come to real life,"" she says. ""Recently, we have more and more of these kinds of situations… xenophobic [abuse] of people working in shops or hotels just because they speak with a Ukrainian accent.""

Natalia says that many Ukrainian refugees are traumatised. ""These groups of women and children are in Poland because of the war, very often their relatives are on the front line, in captivity or dead... and this is the group of people being targeted.""

Research suggests that Poland's public opinion of Ukrainians is indeed worsening. According to a March 2025 poll by the respected CBOS Centre, just 50% of Poles are in favour of accepting Ukrainian refugees, a fall of seven percentage points in four months. Two years ago, the figure was 81%.

Around a million Ukrainians are officially registered as having arrived after the start of the full-scale invasion. Poland spends 4.2% of its GDP on Ukrainian refugees.

Ukraine has become a hot-button political issue in Poland's crucial presidential election campaign.

Far-right populist Slawomir Mentzen, currently polling third, is virulently anti-Ukrainian and supports an ""agreement"" with Russia's Vladimir Putin.

In second place is conservative Karol Nawrocki, who opposes EU and Nato membership for Ukraine and financial assistance for refugees, but supports the war effort.

The most pro-Ukraine candidate is front-runner Rafal Trzaskowski from Prime Minister Donald Tusk's coalition, although even he has promised a reduction in social welfare for Ukrainians.

Trzaskowski has refrained from espousing his pro-Ukrainian credentials in order to attract the centrist vote in the elections, says political analyst Marcin Zaborowski.

""He's responding to the change in public attitudes. The initial enthusiasm for supporting war victims is disappearing, negative sentiments are taking over and it's not an entirely comfortable issue for him.""

Another far-right candidate, Grzegorz Braun, is under investigation by police for tearing down a Ukrainian flag from a city hall building during an election rally in April. Braun, who is polling at just 3%, regularly fulminates against what he calls the ""Ukrainisation of Poland"".

Last week, the Polish government warned of an ""unprecedented attempt"" by Russia to interfere in the Polish elections by spreading ""false information among Polish citizens online"". Moscow denies all allegations of election interference.

Michal Marek, who runs an NGO that monitors disinformation and propaganda in Poland, offers some examples of the anti-Ukraine material being circulated on social media.

""The main narratives are that Ukrainians are stealing money from the Polish budget, that Ukrainians do not respect us, that they want to rob and kill us and are responsible for the war,"" he says.

""This information starts in Russian-speaking Telegram channels, and, after that, we see the same photos and the same text just translated by Google Translate. And they are pushing [the material] into the Polish infosphere.""

Mr Marek links such disinformation directly with the increase in anti-Ukraine sentiment in Poland, and says an increasing number of Poles are becoming influenced by propaganda.

""But we will only see the effect after the election - what percentage of Poles want to vote for openly pro-Russian candidates.""",2025-05-14T08:58:15Z
"Uruguay's José Mujica, world's 'poorest president', dies","Former Uruguayan President José Mujica, known as ""Pepe"", has died at the age of 89.

The ex-guerrilla who governed Uruguay from 2010 to 2015 was known as the world's ""poorest president"" because of his modest lifestyle.

Current President Yamandú Orsi announced his predecessor's death on X, writing: ""thank you for everything you gave us and for your deep love for your people.""

The politician's cause of death is not known but he had been suffering from oesophageal cancer.

Because of the simple way he lived as president, his criticism of consumerism and the social reforms he promoted - which, among other things, meant Uruguay became the first country to legalise the recreational use of marijuana - Mujica became a well-known political figure in Latin America and beyond.

His global popularity is unusual for a president of Uruguay, a country with just 3.4 million inhabitants where his legacy has also generated some controversy.

In fact, even though many tended to see Mujica as someone outside the political class, that was not the case.

He said his passion for politics, as well as for books and working the land, was passed on to him by his mother, who raised him in a middle-class home in Montevideo, the capital city.

As a young man, Mujica was a member of the National Party, one of Uruguay's traditional political forces, which later became the centre-right opposition to his government.

In the 1960s, he helped set up the Tupamaros National Liberation Movement (MLN-T), a leftist urban guerrilla group that carried out assaults, kidnappings and executions, although he always maintained that he did not commit any murder.

Influenced by the Cuban revolution and international socialism, the MLN-T launched a campaign of clandestine resistance against the Uruguayan government, which at the time was constitutional and democratic, although the left accused it of being increasingly authoritarian.

During this period, Mujica was captured four times. On one of those occasions, in 1970, he was shot six times and nearly died.

He escaped from prison twice, on one occasion through a tunnel with 105 other MLN-T prisoners, in one of the largest escapes in Uruguayan prison history.

When the Uruguayan military staged a coup in 1973, they included him in a group of ""nine hostages"" who they threatened to kill if the guerrillas continued their attacks.

During the more than 14 years he spent in prison during the 1970s and 1980s, he was tortured and spent most of that time in harsh conditions and isolation, until he was freed in 1985 when Uruguay returned to democracy.

He used to say that during his time in prison, he experienced madness first hand, suffering from delusions and even talking to ants.

The day he was freed was his happiest memory, he says: ""Becoming president was insignificant compared to that.""

A few years after his release, he served as a lawmaker, both in the Chamber of Representatives and in the Senate, the country's lower and upper houses respectively.

In 2005, he became minister in the first government of the Frente Amplio, the Uruguayan leftist coalition, before becoming Uruguay's president in 2010.

He was 74 years old at the time, and, to the rest of the world, still unknown.

His election marked an important moment for the Latin American left, which was already strong on the continent at that time. Mujica became leader alongside other left-wing presidents such as Luis Inácio Lula da Silva in Brazil and Hugo Chávez in Venezuela.

However, Mujica governed in his own way, demonstrating pragmatism and audacity on several occasions, political commentators say.

During his administration, amid a fairly favourable international context, the Uruguayan economy grew at an average annual rate of 5.4%, poverty was reduced, and unemployment remained low.

Uruguay also drew global attention for the social laws passed by parliament during those years, such as the legalisation of abortion, the recognition of same-sex marriage, and state regulation of the marijuana market.

While in office, Mujica rejected moving into the presidential residence (a mansion), as heads of state around the world usually do.

Instead, he remained with his wife - politician and former guerrilla Lucía Topolansky - in their modest home on the outskirts of Montevideo, with no domestic help and little security.

This combined with the fact that he always dressed casually, that he was often seen driving his light blue 1987 Volkswagen Beetle and gave away a large portion of his salary, led some media outlets to call him ""the world's poorest president"".

But Mujica always rejected that title: ""They say I'm the poorest president. No, I'm not,"" he told me in a 2012 interview at his home. ""Poor are those who want more [...] because they're in an endless race.""

Despite Mujica preaching austerity, his government did significantly increase public spending, widening the fiscal deficit and leading his opponents to accuse him of waste.

Mujica was also criticised for failing to reverse the growing problems in Uruguayan education, despite having promised that education would be a top priority for his administration.

However, unlike other leaders in the region, he was never accused of corruption or of undermining his country's democracy.

By the end of his administration, Mujica had a high domestic popularity rating (close to 70%) and was elected senator, but also spent part of his time travelling the world after he stepped down as president.

""So what it is that catches the world's attention? That I live with very little, a simple house, that I drive around in an old car? Then this world is crazy because it's surprised by [what is] normal,"" he reflected before leaving office.

Mujica retired from politics in 2020 though he remained a central figure in Uruguay.

His political heir, Yamandú Orsi, was elected president of Uruguay in November 2024 and his group within the Frente Amplio obtained the largest number of parliamentary seats since the country's return to democracy.

Last year, Mujica announced he had cancer and references to his age and the inexorable proximity of death became more frequent - but he always accepted the final outcome as something natural, without drama.

In the last interview he gave the BBC in November last year, he said: ""One knows that death is inevitable. And perhaps it's like the salt of life.""",2025-05-14T08:58:15Z
"White South Africans going to US are cowards, Ramaphosa says","President Cyril Ramaphosa has called a group of 59 white South Africans who have moved to the US to resettle ""cowards"", saying ""they'll be back soon"".

The group of Afrikaners arrived in the US on Monday after President Donald Trump granted them refugee status, saying they faced racial discrimination.

But Ramaphosa said those who wanted to leave were not happy with efforts to address the inequities of the apartheid past, terming their relocation a ""sad moment for them"".

""As South Africans, we are resilient. We don't run away from our problems. We must stay here and solve our problems. When you run away you are a coward, and that's a real cowardly act,"" he added.

Trump and his close ally, South Africa-born Elon Musk, have said there was a ""genocide"" of white farmers in South Africa - a claim that has been widely discredited.

The US has also accused the South African government of seizing land from white farmers without paying compensation.

More than 30 years after the end of decades of rule by South Africa's white minority, black farmers own only a small fraction of the country's best farmland, with the majority still in white hands, leading to anger over the slow pace of change.

In January President Ramaphosa signed a controversial law allowing the government to seize privately owned land without compensation in certain circumstances, when it is deemed ""equitable and in the public interest"".

But the government says no land has yet been seized under the act.

Trump has offered to resettle the white Afrikaners, descendants of mostly Dutch settlers, saying they were fleeing a ""terrible situation"" in South Africa.

Speaking on Monday at an agricultural exhibition in the Free State province, Ramaphosa said the Afrikaners were moving to the US because they were not ""favourably disposed"" to efforts aimed at addressing the country's challenges.

""If you look at all national groups in our country, black and white, they've stayed in this country because it's our country and we must not run away from our problems. We must stay here and solve our problems,"" Ramaphosa said.

""I can bet you that they will be back soon because there is no country like South Africa,"" he added.

His ""coward"" remark angered some social media users, who condemned it as an insult to aggrieved white South Africans.

The group of Afrikaners were welcomed by top US officials who claimed they had been ""living under a shadow of violence and terror"" in South Africa.

""Welcome to the land of the free,"" Deputy Secretary of State Chris Landau said as he received the South Africans who landed at Dulles airport near Washington DC on Monday.

Some held young children and waved small American flags in the arrival area adorned with red, white and blue balloons on the walls.

Earlier on Monday, President Ramaphosa told an Africa CEO forum in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, that he had recently told Trump during a phone call the US assessment of the situation was ""not true"".

""We're the only country on the continent where the colonisers came to stay and we have never driven them out of our country,"" he added, dismissing claims Afrikaners were being persecuted.

Ramaphosa said dozens of white South Africans who arrived in the US on Monday ""don't fit the bill"" for refugees.

The South African leader said that he is set to meet Trump soon regarding the issue.

Trump has threatened to boycott the forthcoming G20 summit in South Africa unless the ""situation is taken care of"".

Canada's Carney unveils cabinet of familiar and fresh faces amid US trade war,"Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has unveiled his cabinet, promising ""decisive action"" on his ambitious economic agenda, amid a trade war with the US.

The new cabinet of 28 ministers and 10 secretaries of state heralds some significant changes, including a new foreign minister to handle the US-Canada relationship.

The reshuffle, two weeks after the election, brings some familiar names as well as political newcomers - a team ""purpose-built for this hinge moment"", Carney told reporters.

There are 24 new faces in cabinet, including 13 first-time MPs. Several veterans of former PM Justin Trudeau's government, such as Melanie Joly and Chrystia Freeland, return to cabinet.

Other holdovers from the Trudeau era include Anita Anand, Gary Anandasangaree, Sean Fraser and Dominic LeBlanc.

But housing, immigration and energy - key departments for which the Trudeau government was heavily criticised - have been given to first-time ministers.

Carney is also continuing Trudeau's policy of maintaining gender parity in his cabinet.

""Canada's new ministry is built to deliver the change Canadians want and deserve,""  Carney said on Tuesday.

He has made a number of changes to the core team of ministers handling the strained relationship with the US.

It comes after Carney recently met Trump at the White House, after which he said the US leader was willing to negotiate a new trade deal.

Veteran member of parliament (MP), Dominic LeBlanc, who has overseen a number of cabinet positions, most recently international trade, will now focus on Canada-US trade and breaking down internal trade barriers within the country - a key campaign pledge.

Toronto-area MP Maninder Sidhu, takes over as minister of international trade.

Carney has also named a new foreign minister, Anita Anand, who held a number of top roles in Trudeau's cabinet, including defence.

Melanie Joly was shuffled out of foreign affairs and given the industry portfolio.

Former justice minister Gary Anandasangaree now takes on the role of public safety, a department that will oversee border security, which Trump has cited as a key reason for imposing tariffs on Canada as well as Mexico.

David McGuinty, who previously held that position, now oversees defence.

Two prominent names have been pushed out of the cabinet - Bill Blair, who oversaw defence, and Jonathan Wilkinson, natural resources minister.

Rookie MP Tim Hodgson, first elected in April, is taking over at natural resources. Carney worked with him at the Bank of Canada, where Hodgson served as a special adviser.

The 10 secretaries of state will assist the senior ministers on key portfolios.

Some notable names remaining in their roles include Francois-Philippe Champagne, who stays on as finance minister, a position he has held since March.

Chrystia Freeland, the deputy prime minister under Trudeau and a former foreign affairs and finance minister in his government, stays in transport.

Steven Guilbeault will continue to oversee Canadian culture and official languages.

Federal cabinets in Canada by tradition balance representation of the country's regional, linguistic and ethnic diversity.

The new cabinet includes representation from Canada's prairie provinces - a minister and secretary of state - where there are growing musings about separation amid a broader sense of western alienation from the power centre in Ottawa.

Some of the new faces include former broadcaster Evan Solomon, who will be minister of artificial intelligence and digital innovation.

Toronto MP Julie Dabrusin joins cabinet for the first time as environment minister after having served as parliamentary secretary for the file since 2021.

Halifax MP Lena Metlege Diab is also new to cabinet in the role of minister for immigration.

Vancouver's former mayor, Gregor Robertson, takes on a significant role overseeing housing. Carney has pledged to significantly ramp up construction amid a housing affordability crisis in Canada.

Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre criticised Carney for keeping so many ministers who served in Trudeau's cabinet.

""That isn't the change that Mr Carney promised,"" he said.",2025-05-14T08:58:15Z
Wild chimpanzees filmed using forest 'first aid',"Chimpanzees in Uganda have been observed using medicinal plants - in multiple ways - to treat open wounds and other injuries.

University of Oxford scientists, working with a local team in the Budongo Forest, filmed and recorded incidents of the animals using plants for first aid, both on themselves and occasionally on each other.

Their research builds on the discovery last year that chimps seek out and eat certain plants to self-medicate.

The scientists also compiled decades of scientific observations to create a catalogue of the different ways in which chimpanzees use ""forest first aid"".

Researchers say the study, which is published in the journal Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution, adds to a growing body of evidence that primates, including chimps, orangutans and gorillas, use natural medicines in a number of ways to stay healthy in the wild.

Lead researcher Elodie Freymann explained there was ""a whole behavioural repertoire that chimpanzees use when they're sick or injured in the wild - to treat themselves and to maintain hygiene"".

""Some of these include the use of plants that can be found here,"" she explained. ""The chimpanzees dab them on their wounds or chew the plants up, and then apply the chewed material to the open injury.""

The researchers studied footage of a very young, female chimpanzee chewing plant material and applying it to an injury on its mother's body.

They also found records of chimpanzees tending to the wounds of other animals  they weren't related to. This is particularly exciting, explained Dr Freymann, ""because it adds to the evidence that wild chimpanzees have the capacity for empathy"".

Some of the hundreds of written observations that Dr Freymann and her colleagues studied came from a log book at the field station in the forest site, which is northwest of the capital, Kampala.

This record of anecdotal evidence dates back to the 1990s – local field staff, researchers and visitors have written in, describing any interesting behaviour they have observed.

There are stories in that book of leaf-dabbing on injuries and chimps helping other chimps to remove snares from their limbs.

There are some surprisingly human-like hygiene habits: One note describes a chimpanzee using leaves to wipe itself after defecating.

This team of researchers has previously identified some of the plants that chimpanzees sought out and ate when they were injured. The scientists took samples of those plants, tested them and discovered most had antibacterial properties.

Chimpanzees are not the only non-human apes with apparent knowledge of plant-based medicine. A recent study showed a wild oranguatan using chewed leaf material to heal a facial wound.

Scientists think studying this wild ape behaviour - and understanding more about the plants the chimps use when they are sick or injured - could help in the search for new medicines.

""The more we learn about chimpanzee behaviour and intelligence, the more I think we come to understand how little we as humans actually know about the natural world,"" Dr Freymann told BBC News.

""If I were plopped down here in this forest with no food and no medicine, I doubt that I'd be able to survive very long, especially if I were injured or sick.""

""But chimpanzees thrive here because they know how to access the secrets of this place, and how to find all they need to survive from their surroundings.""",2025-05-14T08:58:15Z
Plane crash victims' families file complaint against Jeju Air CEO,"Some families of those killed in a Jeju Air plane crash last December have filed a criminal complaint against 15 people, including South Korea's transport minister and the airline's CEO, for professional negligence.

The 72 bereaved relatives are calling for a more thorough investigation into the crash, which killed 179 of the 181 people on board - making it the deadliest plane crash on South Korean soil.

The crash was ""not a simple accident"", they allege, but a ""major civic disaster caused by negligent management of preventable risks"".

Nearly five months on, authorities are still studying what may have caused the plane to crash-land at Muan International Airport and then burst into flames.

The police had already opened a criminal investigation before this latest complaint, and barred Jeju Air CEO Kim E-bae from leaving the country, but no one has been indicted over the incident.

One of the relatives, Kim Da-hye, denounced the ""lack of progress"" in investigations.

""We are filled with deep anger and despair. Having taken this extraordinary measure of filing a criminal complaint, we will not give up and will continue to pursue the truth,"" Mr Kim said in a statement to the media.

Among the 15 people named in the complaint were government officials, airline officials and airport staff responsible for construction, supervision, facility management and bird control.

The complaint filed on Tuesday raises questions around the circumstances of the crash, including whether air traffic control responded appropriately and whether the reinforcement of a mound at the end of the runway violated regulations.

The aircraft, a Boeing 737-800, took off from the Thai capital of Bangkok on the morning of 29 December, and was flying to Muan in South Korea.

Five minutes after the pilots made contact with Muan International Airport, they reported striking a bird and declared a mayday signal.

The pilots then tried to land from the opposite direction, during which the aircraft belly-landed without its landing gear deployed. It later overran the runway, slammed into a concrete structure and exploded.

Earlier this year, investigators said they found bird feathers in both engines of the jet, but did not conclude the extent to which the bird strike was a contributing factor.

Since the incident, some bereaved families have also been targeted by a torrent of conspiracies and malicious jokes online.

These included suggestions that families were ""thrilled"" to receive compensation from authorities, or that they were ""fake victims"". As of March this year, eight people have been apprehended for making such derogatory and defamatory online posts.",2025-05-14T08:58:15Z
Champion cyclist sentenced over Olympian wife's car death,"Former world champion cyclist Rohan Dennis has been given a two-year suspended sentence over a car incident in Australia which killed his wife, fellow Olympian Melissa Hoskins.

Dennis pleaded guilty to one aggravated count of creating the likelihood of harm, after Hoskins was struck by the car he was driving during a fight outside the couple's Adelaide home in 2023.

A judge said Dennis had disregarded his wife's safety, but was not criminally responsible for her death.

Hoskins' parents spoke outside the court after sentencing, saying they were ""glad"" the case was over and they hoped the family could ""move on"".

The court had previously heard that Dennis and Hoskins were arguing about kitchen renovations shortly before the incident occurred, and Hoskins had held on to the car her husband was driving as he tried to leave.

While sentencing Dennis, Judge Ian Press said calling the incident tragic ""really does not do justice to the grief, the anguish and the turmoil those events have brought into the lives of those who knew and loved your wife"".

He said he understood that Dennis had tried to ""de-escalate the argument"" by driving off, but said it did not excuse his actions.

""It was your obligation to stop the vehicle when driving that vehicle became dangerous to her physical wellbeing,"" he said, according to a report by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).

""That you did not stop because you wanted to leave, is a very poor reason for not doing so.""

Hoskins was taken to hospital after being struck but later died of her injuries.

Dennis was initially charged with dangerous driving causing death and driving without due care and pleaded not guilty, but he later admitted to a single, lesser charge.

Dennis' lawyer had argued that he had no intention of harming his wife and either did not know or was ""reckless to the fact"" that Hoskins was holding onto the car.

She  told an earlier hearing that despite his ""stoic"" front, Dennis felt a ""deep, deep grief"".

On Wednesday, Judge Press emphasised that Dennis was not criminally responsible for causing Hoskins' death, and accepted he was remorseful.

""I accept you have a sense of responsibility for all that occurred. I accept you have anguished over what could have been different if you had acted in some other way,"" Judge Press said.

In victim impact statements read to the court last month, Hoskins' mother said that while she accepted Dennis wouldn't have intentionally hurt her daughter, his temper was his ""downfall"" and ""needs to be addressed"".

Speaking outside court, Peter and Amanda Hoskins said they missed their daughter ""terribly"".

""She was someone really special,"" Mr Hoskins said.

He said the family was yet to receive an apology from Dennis, but expected it ""will come with time"".

""It's now time for us to move on, which would be Melissa's expectations of us,"" Mr Hoskins said, adding it was important for the couple to have a ""well-mannered relationship"" with Dennis going forward.

""There are two young children caught up in this tragedy... Clearly, we want to continue to be an integral part of [the] children's lives and their future.""

Hoskins was a world champion cyclist in the Australian team pursuit in 2015, and a two-time Olympian. Her death triggered a wave of tributes from around the world.

She and Dennis married in 2018.

Dennis retired at the end of the 2023 season after a cycling career in which he won a silver medal team pursuit at the London 2012 Olympics and a road time trial bronze at Tokyo 2020. He also won a gold medal at the Commonwealth Games in 2022.",2025-05-14T08:58:15Z
The heartbeat of a billion: What Virat Kohli meant to India,"Virat Kohli's retirement from Tests has left Indian cricket beleaguered and the sporting world gasping in surprise.

Coming on the heels of captain Rohit Sharma quitting a few days earlier, it adds up to a double whammy for India who embark on a tough tour of England for a five-Test series come June without their two most experienced batters.

Like Sharma, Kohli took to Instagram, where he commands more than 270 million followers, to make his retirement public.

""As I step away from this format, it's not easy – but it feels right…'' he explained to his disconsolate fans.

Tributes for Kohli have come in a deluge since: from fellow cricketers, past and present, old and young, and also legends from other disciplines like tennis ace Novak Djokovic and football star Harry Kane, which highlights the sweep and heft of Kohli's global appeal.

Leading India to victory in the Under-19 World Cup in 2008, Kohli was fast tracked into international cricket by the then-chairman of selectors, former India captain Dilip Vengsarkar, against the judgement of others in the cricket establishment.

""Many in the Indian cricket board felt he was too young but he was scoring heavily in domestic cricket, and the hunger to succeed was palpable in him,"" recalls Vengsarkar.

An example of Kohli's obsessive passion for the sport comes imbued with poignancy. Kohli was playing his second Ranji Trophy match for Delhi. His father passed away suddenly with his team in a crisis. After the funeral, he went back and scored a battling 90.

Vengsarkar's approving eye earned Kohli an ODI debut in 2009. At 23, he was the youngest member of India's 2011 ODI World Cup winning team under MS Dhoni. A few weeks later, he made his Test debut in the West Indies. Some months on, during the disastrous tour of Australia with his place under threat, Kohli made a gritty maiden century and never looked back. Within a couple of years he established himself as the pre-eminent batter of his generation.

Brash and provocative, without a benign muscle in his body, he was as volatile as potassium on water in his early years. He was unafraid to take on the most reputed opponents, often indulging in on-field fracases that sometimes earned him criticism.

Happily, this was not to become his defining identity in cricket. Prolific run-getting in dashing style across formats provided another more compelling dimension and was to take him to the pinnacle.

When his idol Sachin Tendulkar retired in 2013, Kohli, allying unbridled ambition with his abundant skills, grabbed the baton hungrily and went on to sketch one of the most stellar careers in cricket history.

He wielded the bat like a Jedi, with great skill and telling thrust to slay opponents, as it were. Coupled with his high-octane persona, his scintillating batting made him a cult hero whose very presence ensured blockbuster box-office returns everywhere he played.

Kohli always wore his passion on his sleeve. He was always demonstrative and dramatic on the field but over a period of time, misplaced angst was sublimated into a raging inner pursuit of excellence that took him to dizzying heights.

Marriage to film star Anushka Sharma made them the country's foremost power couple, putting both under the glare of even more intense spotlight.

Metaphorically, Kohli's outstanding exploits, especially in the first decade of his career, epitomised the emerging India of the 21st century: unabashedly, unrelentingly ambitious, discarding all past demons, willing to take on the best in the world.

His achievements across formats are monumental.

In ODIs, he is third in run aggregate behind Tendulkar and Kumar Sangakarra, but boasts the best average (57.88) among batters who have played more than 100 games. His ability to win ODI matches in the most daunting run chases is the stuff of folklore, many of his record 51 centuries coming in such pursuit.

In T20s, his run aggregate and centuries don't put him in the top five, but he's immortalised himself with incredible knocks, notably 82 not out in an emotion-charged, pulsating match against arch-rivals Pakistan in the 2022 World Cup and a vital 76 in the 2024 final against South Africa, which helped India win the title.

He is also the highest run scorer in the history of the Indian Premier League.

At one point, Kohli averaged 50-plus in all three formats, making him the most productive and versatile batter of his era - way ahead of contemporaries Joe Root, Kane Williamson and Steve Smith. The four were locked in a fascinating, long-running race for batting supremacy.

When it appeared he would break all batting records, Kohli's career took an inexplicable downturn. From the start of the pandemic, the flow of runs began to ebb and centuries became a trickle. In his pomp – between 2014 and 2019 – he had been unstoppable, at one time scoring six double centuries in just 18 months.

The drought of runs hit him most adversely in Test cricket where his average, from a high of 55-plus in 2019 slumped to the current 46.75. In this period, Kohli also lost the captaincy, though his stellar standing in international cricket remained untouched.

Kohli finishes his Test career with 9,230 runs, which puts him 19th overall in aggregate, and fourth among Indians behind Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and Sunil Gavaskar, all of whom finished with a 50-plus average and more centuries. But to judge him only on this yardstick would diminish the massive impact he has had on this format .

As captain, Kohli easily hurdles over Gavaskar, Tendulkar and Dravid. In Test cricket, winning 40 of the 68 matches he led in, making him the fourth most successful in the format. In the Indian context, this assumes Himalayan proportions.

Former Australia captain Greg Chappell says that Kohli's energy, grit, sense of purpose and aura was ""transformative"" for Indian cricket. Chappell marks him out as the most influential Indian captain, ahead of even Sourav Ganguly and M S Dhoni.

Former India captain and chief coach Ravi Shastri, who collaborated with Kohli for years, gives first-hand perspective.

""Kohli made India into a fighting unit, especially when playing overseas,"" says Shastri.

The lack of ICC and IPL titles according to Shastri, is misleading as an index to his  captaincy ability.

""He always played to win, sought and nurtured fast bowlers to win overseas, demanded high intent and supreme fitness from all players, putting himself in the forefront, not as a backseat driver.""

For seven years when Kohli and Shastri collaborated, India were in the top three in ICC rankings in all formats almost continuously which is unprecedented.

The most cherished and significant triumph of  this period came in 2018 when India beat Australia in its own backyard in a Test series for the first time ever.

Australia is where Kohli had launched himself into batting greatness, scoring 692 runs in four Tests in 2014-15. In 2018, he contributed as captain and batter to break an hitherto unassailable psychological barrier. In 2020 touring Australia, Kohli played only one match (which was lost) returning home for the birth of his child. But India, having overcome the mental barrier two years earlier, went on to win the rubber in a melodramatic see-saw series.

Australia was Kohli's happy hunting ground and his last visit Down Under in late 2024 grabbed worldwide attention. He began with a roar, hitting  a century in the first test at Perth. But his form fizzled out alarmingly and made only 190 runs in the five Tests.

How much this contributed to his decision to retire is moot. Advancing years, the dislike of being constantly under harsh scrutiny, wanting to be close to his young family and behind the scene shenanigans that abound in Indian cricket have doubtless played a part too.

Kohli ends his retirement post on Instagram enigmatically.

""I'll always look back at my Test career with a smile. #269 signing off,"" he wrote.

The greatest ambassador for the five-day format in the last decade and a half had moved into the sunset.

How real is the risk of nuclear war between India and Pakistan?,"In the latest India-Pakistan stand-off, there were no ultimatums, no red buttons.

Yet the cycle of military retaliation, veiled signals and swift international mediation quietly evoked the region's most dangerous shadow. The crisis didn't spiral towards nuclear war, but it was a reminder of how quickly tensions here can summon that spectre.

Even scientists have modelled how easily things could unravel. A 2019 study by a global team of scientists opened with a nightmare scenario where a terrorist attack on India's parliament in 2025 triggers a nuclear exchange with Pakistan.

Six years later, a real-world stand-off - though contained by a US-brokered ceasefire on Saturday - stoked fears of a full-blown conflict. It also revived uneasy memories of how fragile stability in the region can be.

As the crisis escalated, Pakistan sent ""dual signals"" - retaliating militarily while announcing a National Command Authority (NCA) meeting, a calculated reminder of its nuclear capability. The NCA oversees control and potential use of the country's nuclear arsenal. Whether this move was symbolic, strategic or a genuine alert, we may never know. It also came just as US Secretary of State Marco Rubio reportedly stepped in to defuse the spiral.

President Trump said the US didn't just broker a ceasefire - it averted a ""nuclear conflict"". On Monday, in an address to the nation, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said: ""[There] is no tolerance for nuclear blackmail; India will not be intimidated by nuclear threats.

""Any terrorist safe haven operating under this pretext will face precise and decisive strikes,"" Modi added.

India and Pakistan each possess about 170 nuclear weapons, according to the think-tank Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri). As of January 2024, Sipri estimated there were 12,121 nuclear warheads worldwide. Of these, about 9,585 were held in military stockpiles, with 3,904 actively deployed - 60 more than the previous year. The US and Russia together account for more than 8,000 nuclear weapons.

The bulk of both India's and Pakistan's deployed arsenals lies in their land-based missile forces, though both are developing nuclear triads capable of delivering warheads by land, air and sea, according to Christopher Clary, a security affairs expert at the University at Albany in the US.

""India likely has a larger air leg (aircraft capable of delivering nuclear weapons) than Pakistan. While we know the least of Pakistan's naval leg, it is reasonable to assess that India's naval leg is more advanced and more capable than Pakistan's sea-based nuclear force,"" he told the BBC.

One reason, Mr Clary said, is that Pakistan has invested nowhere near the ""time or money"" that India has in building a nuclear-powered submarine, giving India a ""clear qualitative"" edge in naval nuclear capability.

Since testing nuclear weapons in 1998, Pakistan has never formally declared an official nuclear doctrine.

India, by contrast, adopted a no-first-use policy following its own 1998 tests. But this stance has shown signs of softening. In 2003, India reserved the right to use nuclear weapons in response to chemical or biological attacks - effectively allowing for first use under certain conditions.

Further ambiguity emerged in 2016, when then–defence minister Manohar Parrikar suggested India shouldn't feel ""bound"" by the policy, raising questions about its long-term credibility. (Parrikar clarified that this was his own opinion.)

The absence of a formal doctrine doesn't mean Pakistan lacks one - official statements, interviews and nuclear developments offer clear clues to its operational posture, according to Sadia Tasleem of Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

Pakistan's nuclear threshold remains vague, but in 2001, Khalid Kidwai - then head of the Strategic Plans Division of the NCA - outlined four red lines: major territorial loss, destruction of key military assets, economic strangulation or political destabilisation.

In 2002, then-president Pervez Musharraf clarified that ""nuclear weapons are aimed solely at India"", and would only be used if ""the very existence of Pakistan as a state"" was at stake.

In his memoir, former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo wrote that he was jolted awake at night to speak with an unnamed ""Indian counterpart"" who feared Pakistan was preparing to use nuclear weapons during the 2019 stand-off with India.

Around the same time, Pakistani media quoted a senior official issuing a stark warning to India: ""I hope you know what the [National Command Authority] means and what it constitutes. I said that we will surprise you. Wait for that surprise… You have chosen a path of war without knowing the consequences for the peace and security of the region.""

During the 1999 Kargil War, Pakistan's then-foreign secretary Shamshad Ahmed warned that the country would not ""hesitate to use any weapon"" to defend its territory. Years later, US official Bruce Riedel revealed that intelligence indicated Pakistan was preparing its nuclear arsenal for possible deployment.

But there is scepticism on both sides over such claims.

Former Indian high commissioner to Pakistan Ajay Bisaria wrote in his memoir that Pompeo overstated both the risk of nuclear escalation and the US role in calming the conflict in 2019. And during Kargil, Pakistan ""knew the Indian Air Force wouldn't cross into its territory"" - so there was no real trigger for even an implicit nuclear threat, insist Pakistani analysts.

""Strategic signalling reminds the world that any conflict can spiral - and with India and Pakistan, the stakes are higher due to the nuclear overhang. But that doesn't mean either side is actively threatening nuclear use,"" Ejaz Haider, a Lahore-based defence analyst, told the BBC.

But nuclear escalation can happen by accident too. ""This could happen by human error, hackers, terrorists, computer failures, bad data from satellites and unstable leaders,"" Prof Alan Robock of Rutgers University, lead author of the landmark 2019 paper by a global team of scientists, told the BBC.

In March 2022, India accidentally fired a nuclear-capable cruise missile which travelled 124km (77 miles) into Pakistani territory before crashing, reportedly damaging civilian property. Pakistan said India failed to use the military hotline or issue a public statement for two days. Had this occurred during heightened tensions, the incident could have spiralled into serious conflict, experts say. (Months later, India's government sacked three air force officers for the ""accidental firing of a missile"".)

Yet, the danger of nuclear war remains ""relatively small"" between India and Pakistan, according to Mr Clary.

""So long as there is not major ground combat along the border, the dangers of nuclear use remain relatively small and manageable,"" he said.

""In ground combat, the 'use it or lose it' problem is propelled by the possibility that your ground positions will be overrun by the enemy."" ('Use it or lose it' refers to the pressure a nuclear-armed country may feel to launch its weapons before they are destroyed in a first strike by an adversary.)

Sumit Ganguly, a senior fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, believes that ""neither India nor Pakistan wants to be labelled as the first violator of the post-Hiroshima nuclear taboo"".

""Furthermore, any side that resorts to the use of nuclear weapons would face substantial retaliation and suffer unacceptable casualties,"" Mr Ganguly told the BBC.

At the same time, both India and Pakistan appear to be beefing up their nuclear arsenal.

With new delivery systems in development, four plutonium reactors and expanding uranium enrichment, Pakistan's nuclear arsenal could reach around 200 warheads by the late 2020s, according to The Nuclear Notebook, researched by the Federation of American Scientists' Nuclear Information Project.

And as of early 2023, India was estimated to have about 680kg of weapons-grade plutonium - enough for roughly 130-210 nuclear warheads, according to the International Panel on Fissile Materials.

Despite repeated crises and close calls, both sides have so far managed to avoid a catastrophic slide into nuclear conflict. ""The deterrent is still holding. All Pakistanis did was to respond to conventional strikes with counter-conventional strikes of their own,"" writes Umer Farooq, an Islamabad-based analyst.

Yet, the presence of nuclear weapons injects a constant undercurrent of risk - one that can never be entirely ruled out, no matter how experienced the leadership or how restrained the intentions.

""When nuclear weapons can be involved, there is always an unacceptable level of danger,""John Erath, senior policy director at the non-profit Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, told the BBC.

""The Indian and Pakistani governments have navigated these situations in the past, so the risk is small.  But with nuclear weapons, even a small risk is too large.""",2025-05-14T08:58:15Z
Is Trump allowed to accept $400m luxury plane as a gift?,"US President Donald Trump has said his administration wants to accept a plane worth an estimated $400m (£303m) as a gift from Qatar, calling it ""a great gesture"" that he would be ""stupid"" to turn down.

The potential move has been labelled ""wildly illegal"" by some members of the rival Democratic Party - something the White House denies - and it has attracted criticism from some of Trump's supporters.

Qatar itself earlier said the reports about the plane were ""inaccurate"", and that negotiations were continuing.

The news comes as Trump visits several countries in the Middle East, including Qatar.

BBC Verify has been looking into the legality of presidents accepting gifts.

On Sunday, US media reported that the Trump administration was preparing to accept a Boeing jumbo jet from the Qatari royal family - saying that the plane would be refitted and used temporarily as Air Force One, the name for the plane used by presidents.

Trump later posted on Truth Social: ""The Defense Department is getting a gift, free of charge, of a 747 aircraft to replace the 40-year-old Air Force One, temporarily, in a very public and transparent transaction.""

When questioned by reporters, Trump said: ""It's a great gesture from Qatar. I appreciate it very much. I would never be one to turn down that kind of an offer.""

In February, Trump said he was ""not happy with Boeing"" about delays to two new Air Force One jets that he is expecting to receive directly from the firm. He added that the White House could instead ""buy a plane or get a plane, or something"".

The Qatari plane was pictured in Palm Beach, Florida, in February where Trump inspected it. It is currently fitted with three bedrooms, a private lounge and an office, according to its specification summary document from 2015.

A Qatari official has told CNN the plane is being given from the Qatari defence ministry to the Pentagon, and that it will be modified to meet Air Force One's safety and security standards.

Experts say this is likely to take years, which means the plane may not be ready for use until near the end of Trump's term.

Trump has said the plane will go directly to his presidential library after he leaves office, and that he ""wouldn't be using it"" after his presidency.

Nonetheless, the move has led to criticism from Democrats as well as some long-time Trump supporters, including Laura Loomer who said: ""This is really going to be such a stain on the admin if this is true.""

Several senior Democrats have claimed that accepting the gift would be illegal.

Democratic Senator Adam Schiff quoted a section of the US Constitution that said no elected official could accept ""any present... of any kind whatever"" from the leader of a foreign state without congressional approval.

Frank Cogliano, a professor of American history at the University of Edinburgh, says this clause ""was intended to prevent bribery to influence the government"".

""It is certainly stretching the Constitution and we have not seen a gift on this scale, or of this nature"", says Professor Andrew Moran, a constitutional law expert at London Metropolitan University.

There have been a number of other laws passed by Congress relating to the acceptance of foreign gifts, such as the Foreign Gifts and Decorations Act of 1966, which means that congressional consent is required for the acceptance of foreign gifts above a certain value.

Currently US officials can accept gifts valued at less than $480 (£363).

Although Trump has referred to the plane ultimately going to his ""library"", experts have suggested he really means his museum foundation.

Ex-presidents typically have a library housing their archive of documents, and a museum - typically funded by private donations - full of memorabilia and open to the public.

Experts who BBC Verify spoke to said the fact that the plane could be given to the administration - and not to the president directly - before being transferred to his museum, may not get around the potential violation of the constitution.

Jordan Libowitz - from the organisation Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington - said any use of the plane by Trump after leaving office would cross a line: ""Reagan's Air Force One ended up in his presidential library, but there's a difference there. The plane was decommissioned, Reagan never flew on it again, and it sits inside as a museum piece.""

The US Justice Department has reportedly drafted a memo explaining why it thinks accepting the jet would be permissible, although this has not been made public.

When the White House Press Secretary, Karoline Leavitt was asked about the legality of the deal, she said: ""The legal details of that are still being worked out, but of course, any donation to this government is always done in full compliance with the law.""

President Trump is on a four-day trip to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and UAE, hoping to drum up investment for the US.

His visit follows a series of business deals announced by the Trump Organization, which is run by the president's sons, Eric and Donald Jr.

These include plans to build golf courses and luxury villas in Qatar and the UAE.

President Trump is not currently affiliated with the Trump Organization, having handed over management responsibilities to his children after entering the White House on 20 January.

A deal was announced by the Trump Organization at the beginning of May to develop a Trump-branded luxury 18-hole golf course and a collection of luxury villas north of Qatar's capital, Doha.

At the time, Eric Trump said: ""We are incredibly proud to expand the Trump brand into Qatar through this exceptional collaboration with Qatari Diar and Dar Global.""

Dar Global is a publicly owned Saudi construction company; Qatari Diar is a Qatari state-owned company.

Separately, on 30 April, the Trump Organization announced it would build ""the region's first Trump International Hotel & Tower"" in the ""heart of Dubai"" consisting of 80 floors of ""luxury living and world-class hospitality"".

Eric Trump also visited the UAE recently, speaking at Token 2049, a cryptocurrency conference, on 1 May.

Asked if Trump was likely to meet anyone involved in the family business during his trip, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said it was ""ridiculous"" to suggest the president was doing anything for his own benefit.

Is the US finally on track to build a high-speed rail network?,"The US is a country of 340 million people, 71 interstate highways, more than 5,000 public airports, and currently no high-speed railways.

Yet with two high-speed rail (HSR) projects now under construction, and others planned, is the US finally on track to start catching up with the fast trains seen in China, Japan and Europe?

Rick Harnish, of US campaign group High Speed Rail Alliance, says it is at least good to see the first two schemes being built.

""The first is the San Francisco to Los Angeles route,"" he explains. ""That's an incredibly challenging route to build because of the mountains in California.

""Then there's Las Vegas to Los Angeles, a relatively easy project to build, as it is flat land.""

In addition, there are plans for a HSR line from Portland in Oregon to Seattle in Washington State, and onto Vancouver in Canada. And another between Dallas and Houston.

Yet Mr Harnish warns that planning efforts for the former are ""moving slowly"", while the Texas line is now more doubtful after President Trump's government cancelled a $63.9m (£48m) grant.

By marked contrast, the total length of China's HSR network will reportedly exceed 50,000 km (31,000 miles) this year.

Meanwhile, the European Union has 8,556 km of HSR lines, led by Spain's 3,190 km.

In the UK, the only current HSR line is High Speed 1, the 68 miles link between the Channel Tunnel and London St Pancreas. But High Speed 2 continues to be constructed from London Euston to Birmingham, despite well-publicised funding issues.

While there is no universally agreed definition on what constitutes HSR, global railways trade group International Union of Railways says that trains generally need to be moving at more than 250 km/h (155 mph).

So why does US lag behind Europe and especially China?

""We're a very car-addicted nation,"" says American rail industry journalist and author Will Doig. ""There's lots of people who just don't think we need it, or don't really want it coming through their area.

""And the US government has really shown a willingness to shut down investment in a lot of projects, especially rail.""

Further complicating the situation in the US is that the boss of the government-owned passenger train service Amtrak, Stephen Gardner, resigned last month. It was widely reported that he stood down after pressure from the White House.

Amtrak currently does not operate any HSR trains. Later this year it is due to enter 28 new 160mph NextGen Acela trains into service on its Northeast Corridor route between Boston and Washington DC. However, only around 50 miles of the 457-mile line can presently allow trains to travel at more than 150mph.

Amtrak is not involved in the high-speed lines being built in California and Nevada. The LA to San Francisco project, called California High-Speed Rail, is being led by the state of California, and due to be completed by 2033.

The line from Los Angeles to Las Vegas, Brightline West, is a privately-run project. It is expected to open in 2028.

Globally, there are 23 nations with HSR, according to Mr Harnish. His non-profit organisation has the sole mission of bringing it to the US.

Allowing HSR trains to run safely is far from straightforward, he adds. ""You can't have any crossings with highways, it needs to be very straight and a sealed corridor.""

In China the country is still building more and more HSR lines, with the total distance expected to reach around 60,000km by 2030.

Chinese cities that get HSR links see their economies increase by 14.2%, according to data from Denmark-based think tank 21st Europe.

Chinese firms are also helping to build HSR systems in other Asian countries, such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam.

Will Doig, who wrote a book called High-Speed Empire, Chinese Expansion, and the Future of Southeast Asia, says that China is not just interested in helping its neighbours improve their rail networks.

""It is a way of China spreading its influence across a region that it felt was geopolitically strategic,"" he says.

""In some of these cases, countries have taken out loans from China so that China can then build the railways."" He warns that this may put them ""in a position where they're beholden to China"".

Europe's growing HSR network is testament to the continent's history of investing in its public infrastructure, says Kaave Pour from 21st Europe.

His think tank is now calling for further expansion of HSR, so that it connects most capitals and main cities in the EU, and those in the UK.

Mr Pour says that if the US wants to develop HSR it needs to start with a cultural shift, a move towards more public transport, and asking itself ""what type of future does it want?"".

Mr Harnish from the High Speed Rail Alliance says that in order for HSR to work in the US, ""the federal government is an essential component"".

Yet as already flagged, the White House has pulled the plug on giving the planned high-speed line between Houston and Dallas a federal grant. US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy described the project as a ""waste of taxpayers' money"".

Scott Sherin is an executive at French train manufacturer Alstom. His firm is suppling Amtrak's new high-speed trains, but he questions whether the US has the political will ""to spend the public purse on rail versus other modes of transportation"".

He also notes that any future HSR lines would struggle to get into city centres such as Dallas and Houston, because there are too many buildings. ""The issue is that the cities are so densely built [in their centres]"".

Will Doig says that going forward he would love to see China helping to build more HSR in the US, but that he is not holding his breath.

""It's politically very difficult,"" he says. ""Which is too bad because without the animosity between the US and China, you could see how a partnership between them could really create great things for America, that America is not so good at building itself.""",2025-05-14T08:58:15Z
El Chapo & Deputy Jesus - why Kenya's president has so many nicknames,"Kenya's President William Ruto is a man of many nicknames.

Deputy Jesus, El Chapo, Hustler and Chicken Seller are just some that he has acquired in recent years.

As is often the case when people are given alternative monikers, some are affectionate but some are intended to mock and reflect a profound anger.

A history of the president's aliases offer a window into how the perception of him has changed.

Ruto has acknowledged the rechristening trend, joking recently that Kenyans are ""finishing"" him with the numerous labels.

""You have given me so many names. I had the name William Kipchirchir Samoei Ruto. You added Survivor… Zakayo... now you are at Kasongo (the title of a Congolese song about abandonment and heartbreak). Will you stop at 10, or should I prepare for more?"" he recently asked.

The crowd, at a rally in the capital, Nairobi, responded that they had yet more.

Before he was elected president in 2022, Ruto attracted handles that bolstered his reputation as a man of the people.

Hustler - Kenyan parlance for someone eking out a living against the odds - helped portray him as someone who would prioritise the needs of the struggling folk.

Chicken Seller, referring to his childhood when he hawked poultry on the roadside, resonated with many who saw his life as an epitome of their own.

""These were very positive [names]. They sold him to the public in terms of votes,"" political analyst Prof Herman Manyora told the BBC arguing that they helped catapult him into the top job.

""Names really stick with Ruto,"" he added.

But the president has been a high-profile figure in Kenyan politics for a long time, including serving as deputy president for nine years up until 2022, and has never been far from controversy.

Prof Manyora recalls the label Arap Mashamba – which translates as ""son of farms"" – coined just under a decade ago and relates to Ruto's ownership of vast tracts of land across the country. Concerns have been raised about how some of these have been acquired.

In 2013, a court ordered Ruto to surrender a 100-acre (40-hectare) farm and compensate a farmer who had accused him of grabbing it during the 2007 post-election violence. He denied any wrongdoing.

Ruto's penchant for quoting Bible verses also earned him the Deputy Jesus tag.

However, it is since his rise to the presidency that the nickname manufacturers have been working overtime – with at least a dozen being created - and they have become increasingly critical.

One that has stood out is Zakayo - Swahili for the name Zaccheaus, a Biblical figure who is portrayed as a greedy tax collector who climbed a tree to see Jesus.

Ruto's government introduced a raft of unpopular taxes and many Kenyans began to say that he had betrayed the ""hustlers"".

""He failed to deliver after becoming president,"" Prof Manyora said.

The pain of paying more taxes, and a perception that the extra money will be wasted,  is often the focus of many conversations.

Last year, young people came out onto the streets of Nairobi for weeks of protests, which turned deadly, against a fresh government proposal to raise taxes that was later dropped.

The chant ""Ruto must go"" became a rallying call for the demonstrators and now Must Go has become another way to refer to the leader.

The creative christeners have also focussed on the allegation that the president enjoys foreign travel.

Hence the title Vasco da Ganya – a play on the name of the 15th Century Portuguese explorer, Vasco da Gama, and the Swahili word danganya, which means ""to lie"".

Ruto's honesty has also been called into question with Kaunda Uongoman, which mimics late Congolese musician Kanda Bongoman.

The first part refers to the president's love for the Kaunda suit - a safari jacket with matching trousers – and Uongoman, which incorporates the Swahili word uongo, meaning ""lies"".

But the president seems impervious to this volley of verbal attacks.

Government spokesman Isaac Mwaura said the manifold nicknames ""don't raise concerns"" in the office of the president but simply ""capture how people view a person"".

Ruto is ""very hands on and doing his best to transform the economy... It's normal for any leader to have many nicknames as this signifies his various attributes and initiatives as a leader"", he told the BBC.

Mwaura also argued that in spite of the Zakayo nickname, the government has had to raise taxes to pay for new projects, reduce the budget deficit and fix the economy.

Nevertheless, when people have gone beyond inventing new names and used satire and forms of art to ridicule the president, there has been a negative reaction from officials.

Some cartoons and AI-generated images, including showing the president in a casket, have been described as ""reckless"" and ""distasteful"".

Some of the alleged producers of this online content have been victims of abductions. This, Prof Manyora said, should been seen as a sign of intolerance by the government.

Lachon Kiplimo, a 23-year-old university student, said that while he supported the president, some of the promises he has made are sometimes ""unrealistic"", which fuels the nicknames.

He cited the use of El Chapo, referring to the former Mexican drug lord, after Ruto promised a machine that would produce a million chapatis (also known as chapo in Kenya) every day to feed schoolchildren in the capital.

Mr Kiplimo however reckons that the way the president brushes off the monikers, and in fact seems to embrace them, shows how strong he is.

Prof Manyora believes the young people who come up with the alternative labels for the president do it as a form of catharsis, a way of releasing tension.

This view is backed up by 24-year-old student Margaret Wairimu Kahura, who said that many Kenyans ""are in a lot of pain"".

She feels that the mockery is a way of letting Ruto know how the youth are feeling.

She says that no other Kenyan president has been subjected to this level of lampooning, and ""so this is unique [but] in a bad way"".

It is true that previous heads of state had had nicknames but they have not been so numerous.

The last President, Uhuru Kenyatta, was called Kamwana (""young boy""), Jayden (a Kenyan reference to a pampered or lazy child) and Wamashati (for his love of print shirts).

His predecessor, Mwai Kibaki, was known as General Kiguoya (a general who is afraid) and Fence Sitter.

Perhaps the age of social media, with its insatiable appetite for new content to keep people amused has increased the trend towards name calling.

But for many, like Ms Kahura, the volume of nicknames for Ruto are a genuine reflection of ""the different problems that people are facing"".

Will this woman be the first Briton to walk on the Moon?,"Rosemary Coogan is surrounded by a team of people pushing, pulling, squishing and squeezing her into a spacesuit.

It takes about 45 minutes to get all her gear on before a helmet is carefully lowered over her head.

The British astronaut is about to undergo her toughest challenge yet – assessing whether she is ready for a spacewalk. The test will take place in one of the largest pools in the world: Nasa's Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.

The pool – which is 12m deep (40ft) – contains a life-sized replica of the International Space Station (ISS), and a ""spacewalk"" here is as close as it gets to mimicking weightlessness on Earth.

""It's a big day,"" Rosemary says before the dive, which is going to last more than six hours. ""It's very physically intense – and it's very psychologically intense.""

But Rosemary doesn't seem too fazed. She smiles and waves as the platform she's standing on is slowly lowered into the water.

Being an astronaut was Dr Rosemary Coogan's dream from a young age, she says. But it was a dream that seemed out of reach.

""At the careers day at school, you don't tend to meet astronauts,"" Rosemary says. ""You don't get to meet people who've done it, you don't really get to hear their stories.""

So she decided to study the stars instead, opting for a career in astrophysics. But when the European Space Agency (ESA) announced it was looking for new recruits to go to space, Rosemary applied and was chosen from more than 22,000 people.

ESA aims to get Rosemary to the International Space Station (ISS) by 2030. She'll be following in the footsteps of Britons Helen Sharman, who visited the Soviet's Mir Space Station in 1991, and Tim Peake who launched to the ISS in 2015.

Rosemary has spent the last six months training at the Johnson Space Center. As well as exploring the outside of the submerged ISS, she can head inside the orbiting lab in another life-sized mock-up located in a huge hangar.

She takes us on a tour of the lab's interconnected modules. It feels very cramped, especially considering astronauts usually spend many months on board. But Rosemary reminds us about the spectacular views.

""It is an isolated environment, but I think this helps to give that kind of connection to being outside – to alleviate that sense of claustrophobia.""

Rosemary's training here covers every aspect of going to space - including learning how to use the onboard toilet.

""The lower part is where you put your solid waste,"" she says, pointing to a loo in a small cubicle that looks like something you might find at a very old campsite. ""And this funnel here is actually attached to an air suction system, and that is where you put your liquid waste.""

Female astronauts have the option of suppressing their periods using drugs, Rosemary says, but can also opt not to.

""There's essentially a filter that you put on top of the cone in which you urinate and it's to stop any particles, any blood, from going into the urine system.""

Urine needs to be kept separate because it's purified and treated to be re-used as drinking water, she explains.

Back in the pool, divers are constantly adjusting Rosemary's buoyancy in the water to make the experience as close as possible to microgravity.

She moves around painstakingly, making sure she's always attached to the submerged structure using two hooks.

Every hand-hold is carefully chosen along the bars on the outside of each module. They're in exactly the same positions as the ones on the real thing, vital muscle memory if she gets to carry out a spacewalk 200 miles (322km) above the Earth.

It's slow and difficult work, requiring plenty of upper body strength and physical effort in the hot, bulky spacesuit.

""You do a lot of mental preparation – you really think through every single movement,"" Rosemary explains. ""You have to be really efficient with your energy. You don't want to do something and realise it wasn't quite right and have to do it again.""

Rosemary is working alongside another astronaut to complete a list of space station repairs and maintenance for the test. Her every move is monitored by a team in a control room overlooking the pool. They're in constant communication with her as she works through her tasks.

Former space station commander Aki Hoshide, from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, is on hand for advice. He has completed four spacewalks and says it's a steep learning curve for new astronauts.

""When we first start out, there's so much information thrown at you, so many skills that you have to learn and show and demonstrate,"" he says. ""It is baby steps, but they are moving forward – and I can see their excitement every time they come here and jump in the pool.""

Rosemary takes us to see a Saturn V – the rocket that took the Apollo astronauts to the Moon in 1969. More than 50 years on, Nasa is planning an imminent return to the lunar surface with its Artemis programme. European astronauts will join later missions. With an expected 35-year space career ahead, Rosemary may one day get the chance to become the first Briton to walk on the Moon.

""It's incredibly exciting that we, as humanity, are going back to the Moon, and of course, any way that I could be a part of that, I would be absolutely delighted. I think it's absolutely thrilling,"" she says.

After six gruelling hours underwater, Rosemary is nearing the end of her spacewalk test – but then she's thrown a curve ball.

In the control room, we hear her call out for a comms check with her astronaut partner who's working on another part of the space station. But she's met with silence.

On a video screen, we can see he's motionless. Rosemary doesn't know it, but he's been asked to pretend to lose consciousness. Rosemary's job is to reach him, check his condition – and tow him back to the airlock.

After so long under water, we can see how exhausted she is – but working slowly and steadily, she gets him safely to the airlock.

""Rosemary has the endurance of a champion. She crushed it today,"" says Jenna Hanson, one of Nasa's spacewalk instructors who's been assessing Rosemary. ""We're really happy with where she's at – she's doing awesome.""

The spacewalk is finally over. Rosemary's platform is hoisted out of the pool and the support team help her out of her suit. As her helmet is removed, we can see she's clearly very tired, but still smiling.

""It was a challenging one, it really was, and a challenging rescue,"" she tells us, ""But yeah, it was a really enjoyable day.""

Rosemary's hard work is bringing her ever closer to her dream of getting to space.

""It's amazing,"" Rosemary says, ""If I could do that for the real space station - where you can look out and see the stars and see the Earth at the same time - that would just be the cherry on top.""",2025-05-14T08:58:15Z
'This is my closure': Emotional Kim Kardashian shares fears and forgives robber in court,"Kim Kardashian has given emotional testimony to a Paris court, telling judges she thought she was going to die at the hands of masked gunmen who stole millions of dollars of jewellery from her in a luxury hotel suite in 2016.

The reality TV star and businesswoman - who was bound and had a gun held to her head during the ordeal - faced her alleged attackers for the first time while giving evidence in the case.

Nine men and one woman are on trial for the armed burglary of £10m (£7.55m) worth of jewellery, including a diamond engagement ring from her ex-husband Kanye West.

Kardashian, who gave testimony in a seat in front of the BBC, spoke for more than three hours in court on Tuesday.

Her evidence was at times interrupted by apologies from two defendants.

After one of the defendants, Aomar Ait Khedache, 71, sitting metres from Kardashian in the courtroom expressed his regret, she turned to him and said she forgave him.

Referencing her activism in the US to improve the justice system and her dreams of becoming a lawyer, she thanked Khedache for his apology letter.

""I do appreciate it, I forgive you,"" she said to him in the stand, while crying.

""But it doesn't change the emotion, the feelings and the trauma and the way my life has changed.""

""I just want to thank everyone, especially the French authorities, for allowing me to testify today and tell my truth,"" the TV star told the court on Tuesday which was packed with media.

The trial for the crime committed more than nine years ago has been long-anticipated and closely followed by press.

Wearing a tailored black suit and diamond jewellery, Kardashian was supported in the courtroom by her mother, Kris Jenner, several friends, and a bevy of bodyguards.

She faltered at times in her first hour of giving testimony, fidgeting with her long nails, and pausing when overwhelmed by emotion and fighting back tears. However she appeared to relax and gather strength the longer she went on, her voice becoming steadier.

She also expressed forgiveness for one of the defendants, who issued an apology to her during her testimony.

Tuesday's session in court was the first time Kardashian had relayed to a criminal court her account of the armed burglary, and the extent of her fears during and after the attack.

She recounted how she had been in town for Paris Fashion Week on 2 October, and had retired for the night at around 03:00 when two masked gunmen wearing police uniforms burst into her room, dragging with them the hotel's receptionist who had been bound and gagged.

She managed to call her bodyguard before one of the men then took her phone off her. They snatched her engagement ring, which had been lying on the bedside table, and then ""picked me up off the bed and grabbed me and took me down the hallway"" to look for more jewellery,"" she said.

One of the men held a gun to her back at this point, and ""that was the first moment I thought, should I run for it? But it wasn't an option so I just stayed,"" she said, adding that she realised she should just ""do whatever they say"" for her safety.

Kardashian said she was then thrown onto the bed and her hands bound with zip ties. At this point, she told the concierge: ""Please translate to them that I have babies, I have to make it home.""

One of the men then pulled her towards him, which opened her robe, under which she wasn't wearing anything.

She told the court she was afraid she was going to be raped, saying she said a prayer to mentally prepare herself.

But then her legs were tied together and a gun pointed at her. She said at that point, ""I was sure that's when they were going to shoot me.""

She thought of her family at that point, offering them a ""prayer"" that they would not have to experience her killing.

She expressed fear for her sister,  Kourtney, having to walk into the hotel room to find that ""I would be shot dead on the bed and she would see that and have that memory forever.""

When asked by the judge David de Pas if she thought she was going to die she replied in a small voice: ""I absolutely did think I was gonna die.""

Kardashian said she looked in the eyes of the man who tied her up to try to remember details - and that he told her if she remained quiet, she would be ok.

After the robbers took the jewellery, they dashed out of the suite, leaving Kardashian in the bathroom. She said she then managed to free her hands from the cable ties and hopped down the staircase to the first floor of the suite, where her stylist and friend Simone Harouche helped release the other ties.

The two then ran out onto the balcony where they called for help while hiding in the bushes. Kardashian said she was worried the men would return, and that when Parisian police turned up, she couldn't trust them because the robbers had also been wearing police uniforms.

During the testimony in the packed courtroom, Kardashian also answered several questions from the judge about why her security were not present at the time.

Her usual team had been sent to accompany her sister Kourtney to the club, while Kim had stayed in.

She told the court she did not have a bodyguard with her because up until the robbery, she and her family had not believed they needed that level of security. She said she had previously always felt safe to go out on the streets of Paris on her own, and they had been comfortable with their security team staying at a different hotel.

""Everything changed"" after Paris, she said, noting that she employs up to six people to guard her house at night now, and that she started to get a ""phobia of going out"" because she thought people would ""see me out and know my home was empty"".

""I can't even sleep at night if I know there's not multiple security"" guards, she said, noting her concern about copycat attacks, and that her Los Angeles house was robbed even before the family returned from the Paris trip.

Kardashian's testimony on Tuesday was interrupted at several points by offers of apology from two of the defendants in the court room, who have pleaded guilty to the charge. While she accepted Khedache's apology, she did not acknowledge the presence of the other defendants who are contesting the charges.

She ignored her former driver Gary Madar who is accused of having tipped off the burglary ring about her whereabouts. He has denied the charges.

She also expressed anger over one of the defendants who has pleaded guilty, Yunice Abbas, who published a memoir in 2021 prior to the trial titled '""I Held Up Kim Kardashian"".

Kardashian told the court on Tuesday she was ""really shocked when I saw there was a book"".

""Not only did he do this, but now [he's] making money off that - my jewellery, my memories, the watch my dad who passed away gave me when I graduated high school. I can't get that back.""

She also told the court she wanted closure from the trial's proceedings.

""I wanted to be a part of today because I am a victim in this case and it's the first time I'm able to really hear from everyone and follow along,"" she said.

""This is what I do. I want to become a lawyer and I do believe everyone has the opportunity to speak their truth, and this is my closure and my opportunity to put this to rest after everything I've been through.""

Kardashian added that her job is ""to tell my truth and hope this doesn't happen to anyone else"".

Case quacked: Flying duck caught by Swiss speed camera is repeat offender,"A duck has been caught speeding on traffic cameras in the town of Koeniz in central Switzerland.

Local police said the mallard - a wild duck - was snapped on radar images on 13 April clocking in at 52km/h (32 mph) in a 30km zone.

Adding to the mystery, authorities said the duck was likely a repeat offender and shared an image of a similar looking duck travelling in the same spot, at the same speed and on the same date in 2018.

There has been speculation about whether the ""notorious racer"" duck incident was a belated April Fool's joke, but the police inspectorate said it is impossible to manipulate images on the radar system.

Authorities said traffic cameras are tested each year by Switzerland's Federal Institute of Metrology and the photos taken are sealed.

In a Facebook post, Koeniz officials wished the public ""a lot of fun"" in making sense of the ""curious coincidences"" seven years in the making.

""We wish you a lot of fun sensing about curious coincidences, criminal machinations of animals and the maximum flight speed of ducks,"" the post read.

Some comments have asked what the penalty will be for the ""racer duck's"" transgressions.",2025-05-14T08:58:15Z
Gary Lineker deletes 'Zionism' post after criticism,"Gary Lineker has deleted an Instagram story post he shared from the group Palestine Lobby, which said: ""Zionism explained in two minutes"" and featured an illustration of a rat.

A rat has historically been used as an antisemitic insult, referring to language used by Nazi Germany to characterise Jews.

Lineker's agent told the BBC the presenter immediately deleted the post when he learned about the image's symbolism.

The charity Campaign Against Antisemitism said it was submitting a complaint to the BBC.

Lineker's agent said: ""Whilst viewing and reposting a video, Gary did not notice a rodent emoticon added by the author of the post. Although if he had, he would not have made any connection. The repost has been removed.""

In response to Lineker's post, Campaign Against Antisemitism posted on X: ""Nothing to see here. Just Gary Lineker's Instagram account sharing an anti-Israel video misrepresenting Zionism, complete with a rat emoji.""

The group added that his ""continued association with the BBC is untenable. He must go"".

The BBC, when asked if it had any comment on Lineker's now-removed post, responded by referring to its guidance on personal use of social media.

Zionism refers to the movement to create a Jewish state in the Middle East, roughly corresponding to the historical land of Israel, and thus support for the modern state of Israel.

A spokesperson for the Board of Deputies of British Jews said they felt ""the BBC should ask him to leave now rather than allowing him to dictate his own terms"", according to the Daily Mail.

""He has caused great offence with this video – particularly with his egregious use of a rat emoji to illustrate Zionists.""

BBC News has asked the body about its comments and if it has anything further to add.

Barrister Simon Myerson KC, who chairs the Leeds Jewish Representative Council, posted a message to the outgoing Match of the Day presenter, which said: ""Posting racism - bad. Deleting racist post - good. Not acknowledging error when paid enormous amount of public money pa by BBC - pathetic.""



Last month, Lineker spoke to BBC presenter Amol Rajan about his views on the Middle East.

The sports presenter said: ""I know where I stand on this... What's going on there [Gaza], the mass murder of thousands of children is probably something we should have a little opinion on.""

The war in Gaza was triggered by the Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October 2023 in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others taken hostage.

Israel launched a mass military offensive on Gaza in response which has killed 52,908 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.

Rajan responded to Lineker's comment that the BBC ""as a whole needs to be impartial about it"", to which Lineker replied: ""Why? It needs to be factual.""

The journalist said the BBC, as a public broadcaster, needs to be ""impartial about conflict"", to which Lineker replied: ""It wasn't impartial about Ukraine and Russia... I think facts are the most important thing.""

Lineker was temporarily suspended from the BBC in March 2023 after an impartiality row over comments he made criticising the then-government's new asylum policy.

Reflecting on his tweets in the interview with Rajan, Lineker said he did not regret taking the position he did, but that he would not do it again because of the ""damage"" it did to the BBC.

In February, Lineker made headlines when he was among 500 other high-profile figures who signed an open letter urging the BBC to reinstate a documentary, Gaza: How to Survive a War Zone, to BBC iPlayer.

The documentary was pulled from the streaming service in February after it emerged its 13-year-old narrator was the son of a Hamas official.

After concerns were raised, the BBC took down the film while it carried out further due diligence. The corporation has apologised and admitted ""serious flaws"" in the making of the film and the matter is still subject to an internal investigation.

Lineker and the BBC jointly announced in November that he would be stepping down from presenting Match of the Day, although he will still host World Cup and FA Cup coverage.

On top of his presenting roles, Lineker is also the co-founder of Goalhanger Podcasts, which make the successful The Rest is History series and its spin-offs about Politics, Football, Entertainment and Money.

The Rest is Football podcast, featuring Lineker, Alan Shearer and Micah Richards, is also on BBC Sounds.

Biden aide hits back at book alleging cover-up of his 'deterioration',"Joe Biden's aides have hit back at a new book that accuses a White House inner circle of covering up the former US president's ""physical deterioration"" during his ill-fated re-election campaign.

According to the book, Original Sin, Biden's condition during his 2024 presidential run was said to be so poor that aides discussed putting him in a wheelchair.

A spokesperson for Biden, 82, said ""evidence of aging is not evidence of mental incapacity"" and maintained the Democrat had been ""a very effective president"".

The book, by CNN's Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson of Axios, is due to be released on 20 May.

Biden abruptly ended his re-election campaign last July shortly after his disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump, a Republican.

Party insiders blamed him for exiting the race too late, leaving his replacement, Vice-President Kamala Harris, 107 days to challenge Trump, who swept to victory.

Ahead of the book's release, Biden last week gave his first interview since leaving the White House to the BBC, saying: ""I don't think it would have mattered"" if he had left the race sooner.

While the book largely cites anonymous sources in interviews with more than 200 people, one of the few to be quoted on the record is David Plouffe, who worked on Vice-President Harris's campaign.

""We got so screwed by Biden as a party,"" the book quotes Plouffe as saying.

The authors write: ""Biden's physical deterioration - most apparent in his halting walk - had become so severe that there were internal discussions about putting the president in a wheelchair, but they couldn't do so until after the election.

""Given Biden's age, [his physician Kevin O'Connor] also privately said that if he had another bad fall, a wheelchair might be necessary for what could be a difficult recovery,"" the book adds.

Biden's physical condition had declined so much, the authors said, that aides had sought to ensure he walked shorter distances, used handrails when mounting stairs, and wore trainers more often.

At the time, Biden aides repeatedly told reporters his altered gait was due to a foot fracture in November 2020 and his subsequent refusal to consistently wear his prescribed surgical boot.

In a statement to Axios, an anonymous Biden aide said: ""Yes, there were physical changes as he got older, but evidence of aging is not evidence of mental incapacity.""

The spokesperson added: ""We are still waiting for someone, anyone, to point out where Joe Biden had to make a presidential decision or make a presidential address where he was unable to do his job because of mental decline.

""In fact, the evidence points to the opposite - he was a very effective president.""

Tapper and Thompson's book also says that Biden did not recognise George Clooney at a star-studded California campaign fundraiser last June  hosted by the Hollywood star.

""Thank you for being here,"" Biden told Clooney at the event, apparently unaware he was speaking to the Academy Award winner.

""You know George,"" an aide reportedly told Biden, as he was struggled to work out Clooney's identity.

Not long after the incident, Clooney wrote an opinion piece in the New York Times calling on Biden to quit the race. The actor was one of the first major donors to publicly withdraw his support.

The book also alleges that Biden forgot the names of veteran aides, including trusted loyalist Mike Donilon, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and White House communications director Kate Bedingfield.

Airbnb offers private chefs and massages as it revamps app,"Airbnb says users will now be able to book luxury services like personal trainers, massages and chefs on its redesigned app as it continues to expand beyond its main short-term rentals business.

""People choose hotels for their services. People choose Airbnbs for the space... now, we're giving you the best of both worlds"", the company's chief executive Brian Chesky said in a statement.

It comes just weeks after the firm signalled bookings may slow in the US as President Trump's unpredictable trade policies hit consumer sentiment.

Despite hosting more than two billion guests since its launch in 2008, Airbnb has also faced challenges in recent years with some cities moving to ban short lets.

Airbnb's new services will initially be available in 260 cities, with the company saying they will cost from below $50 (£37.57).

The luxury offerings, which include spa treatments, photographers and makeup artists, can also be booked by people who are not staying in Airbnbs.

The company's revamped app also includes an updated experiences tab, allowing users to book bespoke tours and activities. That service was first launched in 2016.

The new hotel-like features reflect the changing needs of tourists, Gary Bowerman, director of travel marketing firm Check-in Asia told the BBC.

""Travellers are now thinking much more about how to customise the trip for themselves, not just the actual functional parts of how they get there and where they stay.""

Another feature of the new app is an originals tab, which offers exclusive experiences across the world.

This includes playing beach volleyball in Rio de Janeiro with Olympian Carol Solberg or spending a Sunday with National Football League superstar Patrick Mahomes.

Bespoke options like this are part of a wider trend as tourists seek out off-the-beaten path experiences, said luxury travel consultant Anastasia Oriordan.

""There are so many people that have travelled and done so many things, that the benchmark or the goalpost for unique experiences is constantly moving.""",2025-05-14T08:58:15Z
Convicted killer named as suspect in prison stabbing of rapper Tory Lanez,"An inmate who allegedly knifed hip-hop artist Tory Lanez inside a US prison is a convicted killer, say prison officials.

The Canadian rapper was rushed to hospital after being stabbed 14 times on Monday morning at a housing unit at the California Correctional Institution in Tehachapi.

The prisoner suspected of the attack, Santino Casio, 41, is serving a life sentence for murder, officials told the BBC. They said he has been placed in ""restricted housing"" pending an investigation into the attack on Lanez, 32.

The rapper, whose legal name is Daystar Peterson, is serving a 10-year prison sentence for shooting fellow musician Megan Thee Stallion in 2020.

Casio arrived at the Tehachapi institution from Los Angeles County jail in February 2004.

""He was sentenced to life with the possibility of parole for second-degree murder, first degree attempted murder, personal use of a dangerous or deadly weapon, and inflict [sic] great bodily injury,"" said a statement from the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR).

Casio has added to his criminal record during his incarceration, the statement added.

In January 2008, he was sentenced to six years for assaulting a fellow prisoner with a deadly weapon.

In 2018, he was sentenced to another two years for possessing a deadly weapon.

Casio's alleged attack left Tory Lanez with wounds across his body, causing both of his lungs to collapse, according to a post on the rapper's Instagram account.

He was stabbed in the back, torso, head and face, and had to temporarily be placed on a breathing apparatus, the Instagram post added.

""Despite being in pain, he is talking normally, in good spirits, and deeply thankful to God that he is pulling through,"" the post said.

Lanez was sentenced in 2023 for three felony gun-related charges, including assault with a semi-automatic firearm.

He shot Megan Thee Stallion, whose legal name is Megan Pete, as they were leaving a pool party at reality star Kylie Jenner's Hollywood mansion.

Lanez had seven US top 10 albums in the seven years before his conviction. He has teased the release of a new album from prison titled Peterson.",2025-05-14T08:58:15Z
Thousands of civil servant jobs to leave London,"Thousands of civil servants are to be moved out of London under plans to save money and shift government jobs to offices across the country.

The government is aiming to cut the number of roles in London by 12,000 and close 11 offices in the capital to save £94m a year by 2032.

The changes will see two new government campuses opened in Manchester and Aberdeen, and roles created in other towns and cities.

Unions welcomed proposals to relocate officials but said they wanted more details on how civil servants would be impacted.

Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden said the government wanted to move decision-making ""closer to communities all across the UK"".

He said: ""By relocating thousands of civil service roles we will not only save taxpayers money, we will make this government one that better reflects the country it serves.""

Speaking to BBC 5 Live, McFadden said he wanted to embrace new technology allowing meetings to take place online, but that this would not mean civil servants would be remote working all the time.

""The same rule will apply wherever people are working in terms of the working from home question, which is we expect people to be in at least 60% of the time,"" he said, adding, ""people don't all have to be in the same place anymore"".

McFadden added he wanted to create ""a civil service that speaks with all the accents of the country, not just one"" and allows career progression outside London.

Shadow Conservative Cabinet Office minister Alex Burghart said the plans showed Labour was ""fundamentally unserious about reducing the size of the state and working more efficiently on behalf of taxpayers"".

He accused Labour of ""shuffling things around and making empty promises"".

""Only the Conservatives are serious about reducing the size of the state and making it work more efficiently for British taxpayers,"" he said.

Government departments are being asked to submit their plans for relocating staff, including senior civil servants, as part of a spending review.

A government source told the BBC the exact number of civil servants relocated will be determined by the spending review, which is due to be completed in June.

The Labour government has set out a number of reforms to shrink the size of the civil service, which ministers believe is bloated and inefficient.

Chancellor Rachel Reeves has promised to reduce government running costs by 15% by the end of the decade, and the Cabinet Office is looking to cut 2,100 jobs in its department over the next two years.

The number of civil service staff has increased considerably since 2016, with the headcount topping 514,000 at the end of last year, according to the Institute for Government.

Last year, a government source told the BBC more than 10,000 civil servants jobs could be cut as part of Labour's push for savings across all departments.

On Wednesday, the government will outline plans to locate 50% of UK-based senior civil servants in regional offices by 2030.

The government wants to create three new regional campuses, one in Manchester focused on digital innovation and AI and a second in Aberdeen focused on energy. The third location is yet to be announced.

Manchester is already home to major offices of the science and culture departments, while Aberdeen houses the new Great British Energy headquarters.

Other roles will be created in Birmingham, Leeds, Cardiff, Glasgow, Darlington, Newcastle and Tyneside, Sheffield, Bristol, Edinburgh, Belfast and York, with the changes expected to bring £729m to the local economy by 2030.

Among the offices being closed in London is 102 Petty France, one of the largest government offices in the capital and home to around 7,000 civil servants in the Ministry of Justice, HM Courts and Tribunal Service, Crown Prosecution Service and the Government Legal Department.

The Government will also close 39 Victoria Street, which has been home to the Department of Health and Social Care since the end of 2017.

Prospect union general secretary Mike Clancy said hundreds of thousands of civil servants already work outside of London and welcomed plans to ""empower"" them.

But he added: ""We have been here before with similar announcements, if this one is to be different, government needs to work closely with unions both on specific relocation plans and on the wider civil service reform agenda.""

Dave Penman, general secretary of the FDA union, said civil servants ""need to be able to build careers for the longer-term across the UK, including in London where there will now be fewer opportunities"".

Penman said Wednesday's announcement meant ""uncertainty"" for ""civil servants working in offices whose closures have been announced today"" and the FDA looked forward to seeing more detail.",2025-05-14T08:58:15Z
