"Israel denying food to Gaza is 'weapon of war', UN Palestinian refugee agency head tells BBC","How do you measure misery? For journalists the usual way is to see it, to feel it, to smell it.

Beleaguered Palestinian colleagues in Gaza are doing that, still doing invaluable reporting at great risk to themselves. More than 200 have been killed doing their jobs.

Israel does not allow international journalists into Gaza.

Denied the chance of eyewitness reporting – one of the best tools of the job – we can study, from a distance, the assessments of aid organisations operating in Gaza.

Pascal Hundt, deputy director of operations at the International Committee of the Red Cross said last week that civilians in Gaza faced ""an overwhelming daily struggle to survive the dangers of hostilities, cope with relentless displacement, and endure the consequences of being deprived of urgent humanitarian assistance.""

He added: ""This situation must not—and cannot—be allowed to escalate further.""

But it might, if Israel continues the plunge deeper into war that resumed on 18 March when it broke a two-month ceasefire with a massive series of air strikes.

Israel had already sealed the gates of Gaza. Since the beginning of March, it has blocked all shipments of humanitarian aid, including food and medical supplies.

The return to war ended any chance of moving on to the ceasefire's proposed second phase, which Israel and Hamas had agreed would end with the release of all the remaining hostages in exchange for a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.

That was unacceptable to the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and the ultra-nationalist religious extremists who keep him in power.

They want Gaza's Palestinians to be replaced by Jewish settlers. They threatened to topple Netanyahu's government if he did not go back to war, and the end of Netanyahu's political career would bring the day of reckoning for his part in Israel's failure to prevent the deadly Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023. It might also force a conclusion in his long trial on corruption charges.

Prime Minister Netanyahu is now promising a new ""intense"" offensive into Gaza in the days after President Donald Trump finishes his swing through the wealthy Arab oil monarchies in the Gulf later this week.

The offensive includes a plan to displace massive numbers of Palestinian civilians on top of waves of artillery, air strikes and death. ""To displace"" is a cold verb. It means families having only handfuls of minutes to flee for their lives, from an area that might be hit immediately to one that might be hit later. Hundreds of thousands have done so repeatedly since the war began.

Gaza was one of the most overcrowded places on earth before the war. Israel's plan is to force as many Gazans as possible into a tiny area in the south, near the ruins of the town of Rafah, which has been almost entirely destroyed.

Before that happens, the UN humanitarian office estimates that 70% of Gaza is already effectively off limits to Palestinians. Israel's plan is to leave them in an even smaller area. The UN and leading aid groups reject Israeli claims that Hamas steals and controls food that comes into Gaza. They have refused to cooperate with a scheme proposed by Israel and the US that would use private security firms, protected by Israeli troops, to distribute basic rations.

Far from Gaza, in London, I talked to Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner-general of Unrwa, the UN agency that supports Palestinian refugees. He told me that he was running out of words ""to describe the misery and the tragedy affecting the people in Gaza. They have been now more than two months without any aid"".

""Starvation is spreading, people are exhausted, people are hungry... we can expect that in the coming weeks if no aid is coming in, that people will not die because of the bombardment, but they will die because of the lack of food. This is the weaponisation of humanitarian aid.""

If words are not enough, look at the most authoritative data-driven assessment of famine and food emergencies in the regular reports issued by Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC. It is a joint venture by UN agencies, aid groups and governments that measures whether a famine is happening.

The latest IPC update says Gaza is close to famine. But it says that the entire population, more than two million people, almost half of whom are children, is experiencing acute food insecurity. In plain English, that means they are being starved by Israel's blockade.

The IPC says that 470,000 Gazans, 22% of the population, are in a classification it calls ""Phase 5 – catastrophe."" The IPC defines it as a condition in which ""at least one in five households experience an extreme lack of food and face starvation resulting in destitution, extremely critical levels of acute malnutrition and death.""

In practical terms, the phase five classification, the most acute used by the IPC, estimates that ""71,000 children and more than 17,000 mothers will need urgent treatment for acute malnutrition"".

Thousands of tons of the food, medical aid and humanitarian supplies that they need are sitting only a few miles away, on the other side of the border in Egypt.

In London I asked Mr Lazzarini whether he agreed with those who have accused Israel of denying food and humanitarian aid to civilians as a weapon of war.

""I have absolutely no doubt,"" he said, ""that this is what we have witnessed during this last 19 months, especially during this last two months. That's a war crime. The quantification will come from the ICJ [International Court of Justice] not from me, but what I can say, what we see, what we observe, food and humanitarian assistance is indeed being used to meet the political or military objective in the context of Gaza.""

I asked Mr Lazzarini whether the blockade, on top of a year and half of war and destruction, might amount to genocide. That is the accusation against Israel levelled by South Africa and other states at the ICJ in The Hague.

""Listen, by any account, the destruction is massive. The number of people who have been killed is huge and certainly underestimated. We have seen the systematic destruction also of a school, of a health centre. People have been constant pinballs within Gaza, moving all the time. So there is absolutely no doubt that we are talking about massive atrocities. Genocide? It could end up to genocide. There are many elements which could go in this direction.""

Israel's defence minister Israel Katz has made no secret of Israel's tactics. Last month Katz said that the blockade was a ""main pressure lever"" to secure victory over Hamas and to get the all the hostages out. The National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir agreed. He wrote that: ""The cessation of humanitarian aid is one of the main levers of pressure on Hamas. The return of aid to Gaza before Hamas gets on its knees and releases all of our hostages would be a historic mistake.""

Netanyahu's plans for another offensive, and the remarks made by Katz, Ben-Gvir and others, horrified Israeli families with hostages still inside Gaza. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum which represents many of them, said minister Katz was pushing an ""illusion... Israel is choosing to seize territory before the hostages.""

Dissident Israeli military reservists also protested, saying that they were being forced to fight again not for Israeli security but for the political survival of the Israeli government. In the air force reserve, 1,200 pilots signed an open letter saying that prolonging the war served mainly ""political and personal interests and not security ones"". Netanyahu blamed a small group of ""bad apples"" for the open letter.

For many months Netanyahu and his government have also accused Mr Lazzarini of lying. One official report posted online in January of this year was headed ""Dismantling Unrwa Chief Lazzarini's Falsehoods"". It claimed that he had ""consistently made false statements which have profoundly misinformed the public debate on this issue"". Unrwa, Israel says, has been infiltrated and exploited by Hamas to an unprecedented degree. It says some Unrwa employees took part in the attacks of 7 October.

Mr Lazzarini denies the personal accusations directed at him by Israel and the broader ones aimed at Unrwa. He says Unrwa investigated 19 staff named by Israel and concluded nine of them may have a case to answer. All 19 were suspended. Mr Lazzarini said that since then Unrwa had received ""hundreds of allegations from the State of Israel. Each time, as a rule-based organisation, we keep asking for substantiated information"". He said they had never received it.

All wars are political, and none more than the ones between Israel and the Palestinians. The war engages and enrages the outside world as well the belligerents.

Israel argues that self-defence justifies its actions since 7 October 2023 when Hamas, Islamic Jihad and others attacked Israel, killed around 1,200 people, mostly Israeli civilians, and took 251 others hostage. Any other government, it says, would have done the same.

Palestinians and an increasingly concerned and outraged chorus of states, including some of Israel's key European allies, say that does not justify the continuation of the most devastating assault on Palestinians since the war of 1948, when Israel gained its independence, which Palestinians call ""the catastrophe"".

Even President Trump shows signs of distancing himself from Benjamin Netanyahu, saying that the people of Gaza must be fed.

The allegation that the total denial of food to Gazan civilians is more evidence of an Israeli genocide against Palestinians has outraged Benjamin Netanyahu, his government and many Israeli citizens. It produced rare political unity in Israel. The leader of the opposition Yair Lapid, normally a stern critic of Netanyahu, condemned ""a moral collapse and a moral disaster"" at the ICJ.

Genocide is defined as the destruction, in whole or in part, of a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group. The International Criminal Court (ICC), a separate body, has issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his former defence minister on war crimes charges, which they reject. The three Hamas leaders who were also the subject of ICC warrants have all been killed by Israel.

It is not too soon to think about the longer-term impact of this devastating war, even though its end is not in sight. Mr Lazzarini told me that ""in the coming years we will realise how wrong we have been… on the wrong side of the history. We have under our watch let a massive atrocity unfold.""

It started, he said, with the Hamas attacks on Israel on the 7 October: ""The largest killing of Israeli and Jewish in the region since World War II"" had been followed by a ""massive"" military response by Israel.

It was, he said, ""disproportionate, basically almost leading to the annihilation of an entire population in their homeland... I think there is a collective responsibility from the international community, the level, the passivity, the indifference being shown until now, the lack of political, diplomatic, economic action. I mean, it's absolutely monstrous, especially in our countries where we have said 'never again'.""

Ahead may be an attempt to realise Donald Trump's dangerous fantasy of Gaza as the Dubai of the Mediterranean, rebuilt and owned by America and without Palestinians. It has given shape to cherished dreams of Israeli extremists who threaten of the removal of Palestinians from the land between the river Jordan and the Mediterranean.

Whatever lies ahead, it will not be peace.",2025-05-13T09:30:00Z
Dozens of white South Africans arrive in US under Trump refugee plan,"A group of 59 white South Africans has arrived in the US, where they are to be granted refugee status.

President Donald Trump has said the refugee applications for the country's Afrikaner minority had been expedited as they were victims of ""racial discrimination"".

The South African government said the group were not suffering any such persecution that would merit refugee status.

The Trump administration has halted all other refugee admissions, including for applicants from warzones. Human Rights Watch described the move as a cruel racial twist, saying that thousands of people - many black and Afghan refugees - had been denied refuge in the US.

The group of white South Africans, who landed at Dulles airport near Washington DC on Monday, received a warm welcome from US authorities.

Some held young children and waved small American flags in the arrival area adorned with red, white and blue balloons on the walls.

The processing of refugees in the US often takes months, even years, but this group has been fast tracked. UNHCR - the United Nations refugee agency - confirmed to the BBC it wasn't involved in the vetting, as is usually the case.

Asked directly on Monday why the Afrikaners' refugee applications had been processed faster than other groups, Trump said a ""genocide"" was taking place and that ""white farmers"" specifically were being targeted.

""Farmers are being killed, they happen to be white, but whether they're white or black makes no difference to me.""

But South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said he told Trump during a phone call the US assessment of the situation was ""not true"".

""A refugee is someone who has to leave their country out of fear of political persecution, religious persecution, or economic persecution,"" Ramaphosa said. ""And they don't fit that bill.""

In response to a question from the BBC at Dulles airport, Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau said: ""It is not surprising, unfortunately, that a country from which refugees come does not concede that they are refugees.""

The US has criticised domestic South African policy, accusing the government of seizing land from white farmers without any compensation.

In January President Ramaphosa signed a controversial law allowing the government to seize privately owned land without compensation in certain circumstances, when it is deemed ""equitable and in the public interest"".

But the government says no land has yet been seized under the act.

There has been frustration in South Africa over the slow pace of land reform in the three decades since the end of the racist apartheid system.

While black South Africans make up more than 90% of the population, they only hold 4% of all privately owned land, according to a 2017 report.

One of Trump's closest advisers, South African-born Elon Musk, has previously said there was a ""genocide of white people"" in South Africa and accused the government of passing ""racist ownership laws"".

The claims of a genocide of white people have been widely discredited.

In a statement to the BBC, Gregory Meeks, ranking Democratic member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said the Trump administration's refugee resettlement was ""not just a racist dog whistle, it's a politically motivated rewrite of history"".

The Episcopal Church said it would no longer work with the federal government on refugee settlement because of the ""preferential treatment"" granted for the Afrikaners.

Commenting on this news on X, Vice-President JD Vance posted, ""Crazy"".

Melissa Keaney, a lawyer with the International Refugee Assistance project, told the BBC the White House's decision to fast-track the Afrikaners' arrival amounted to ""a lot of hypocrisy and unequal treatment"".

Her organisation is suing the Trump administration after it indefinitely suspended the US Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) in January. She said that policy had left over 120,000 conditionally approved refugees in limbo.

Afrikaner author Max du Preez told the BBC's Newsday radio programme that claims of persecution of white South Africans were a ""total absurdity"" and ""based on nothing"".

Figures from the South African police show that in 2024, 44 murders were recorded on farms and smaller plots of agricultural land, with eight of those killed being farmers.

South Africa does not report on crime statistics broken down by race but a majority of the country's farmers are white, while other people living on farms, such as workers, are mostly black.

Bilateral relations between the US and South Africa have been strained since President Trump first tasked his administration with resettling Afrikaners, a group with mostly Dutch ancestry, in the US.

In March, South Africa's ambassador to the US, Ebrahim Rasool, was expelled after accusing President Trump of using ""white victimhood as a dog whistle"", leading to the US accusing Mr Rasool of ""race-baiting"".

The US has also criticised South Africa for taking an ""aggressive"" position against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), where Pretoria has accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government of genocide against Palestinians - a claim the Israelis strongly reject.

President Trump's openness to accepting Afrikaner refugees comes as the US has engaged in a wider crackdown on migrants and asylum seekers from other countries.

The Philippines has voted - now the game of thrones begins again,"As the noise and colour of a two-month election campaign subsides, a game of thrones between the two most powerful families in the Philippines resumes.

President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr, and his Vice-President, Sara Duterte, are embroiled in a bitter feud, and a battle for power.

As allies they won a landslide victory in the last presidential election in 2022.

But as their relationship has fractured - he accusing her of threatening to assassinate him, she accusing him of incompetence and saying she dreamed of decapitating him - this mid-term election has become a critical barometer of the strength of these two political dynasties.

And the results were not great news for the Marcos camp. Typically incumbent presidents in the Philippines get most of their picks for the senate elected in the mid-term election. The power of presidential patronage is a significant advantage, at least it has been in the past.

But not this time.

Only six of the 12 winning senators are from the Marcos alliance, and of those one, Camille Villar, is only half in his camp, as she also accepted endorsement from Sara Duterte.

Four of the senators are in the Duterte camp, including the president's sister Imee Marcos. Two were in the top three vote-winners, ahead of any Marcos candidate.

For a sitting president, this is a poor result.

Senators are elected on a simple, nationwide vote, which is a good indication of national opinion. The result could weaken the authority of the Marcos administration in the last three years of his term, and it casts doubt on the plan to incapacitate Sara Duterte by impeaching her.

The Marcos-Duterte relationship has been deteriorating almost since the start of their administration three years ago. But it was only this year that it ruptured completely.

The decision by the president's allies in Congress to start impeaching the vice-president was the first irreparable breach.

Then in March President Marcos sent Sara's father, former president Rodrigo Duterte, to the International Criminal Court to face charges of crimes against humanity over his brutal war on drugs. The police have also now filed criminal charges against her.

The gloves were off. Impeachment would result in Sara Duterte being barred from public office, ending her ambition to replace President Marcos at the next election.

Right now she is the frontrunner, and few doubt that, if successful, she would use the power of the presidency to seek vengeance against the Marcos's.

But impeachment requires two thirds of the 24-seat senate to vote for it, which is why this mid-term election mattered so much to both camps.

Politics in the Philippines is a family business. Once a family achieves political power, it holds onto it, and passes it around the various generations.

While there are around 200 influential families, the Dutertes and Marcoses sit at the top of the pyramid.

The Marcoses have been in politics for 80 years. The current president's father ruled from 1965 to 1986, imposing martial law, and plundering billions of dollars from the national purse.

Bongbong Marcos' mother, Imelda, who at the age of 95 cast her vote in this election from a wheelchair, is an even more notorious figure, and not just for her shoe collection.

His sister Imee has been re-elected to the senate, thanks to her decision to defect to the Duterte camp.

His eldest son Sandro is a congressman, and his cousin Martin Romualdez is speaker of the lower house and a likely presidential candidate in 2028 - probably the reason why Bongbong Marcos was so keen to drive through the impeachment of Sara Duterte.

In the president's home province of Ilocos Norte, his wife's cousin has been elected governor, his nephew elected vice-governor, and two other cousins elected as city councillors. Up there, Marcoses always win.

Much the same is true of the Dutertes in their stronghold in Davao at the other end of the country.

Even from his prison cell in The Hague, former President Duterte ran for mayor of Davao, and won easily, even though all voters got to see of him was a life-size cardboard cutout.

His absence will not matter though, because the previous mayor was his son Sebastian, who now takes over the vice-mayor's job. Dutertes have been mayors of Davao for 34 out of the last 37 years.

The problem confronting both camps is that the senators also typically come from big political families, or are celebrities in their own right – many candidates come from a media or showbiz background.

They have interests and ambitions of their own. Even if officially allied with one camp or the other, there is no guarantee they will stay loyal, especially on the issue of impeachment.

""Senators in the Philippines are very sensitive to national public opinion, because they imagine themselves as vice presidents or presidents in-waiting,"" says Cleve Arguelles, a political scientist who runs WR Numero Research, which monitors public opinion.

""So, they are always trying to read the public mind, and side with public opinion because of their future political ambitions.""

In recent months public sentiment has not been on the president's side.

Bongbong Marcos has never been a good public speaker, and his stage appearances in the campaign did little to lift his flagging popularity.

His management of the economy, which is struggling, gets low marks in opinion polls, and his decision to detain former President Duterte and send him to the International Criminal Court is being portrayed by the Duterte family as a national betrayal.

At an impromptu rally in Tondo, a low-income neighbourhood in Manila's port area, Sara Duterte played an emotionally-charged video of the moment her father was taken into custody at Manila's international airport and put on a private jet to The Hague. She portrayed this as unforgivable treatment of a still popular former president.

""They didn't just kidnap my dad, they stole him from us,"" she told the cheering crowd.

Also on stage was President Marcos's elder sister Imee, who disagreed with the extradition and jumped ship to the Duterte camp – though most observers view this as a cynical move to capitalise on Duterte popular support, so she could lift her own flagging campaign to retain her senate seat.

It worked. From polling low through much of the campaign, Imee Marcos managed to scrape into the ""magic twelve"", as they call the winning senators.

What happens now is difficult to predict, but the Marcos camp certainly faces an uphill battle to get Sara Duterte impeached.

Of the 24 senators, only a handful are automatically loyal to the president. The rest will have to be persuaded to go along with it, , and that won't be easy.

This election has shown that the Dutertes still have very strong public support in some areas, and some in the Marcos election alliance are already on record as saying they oppose impeaching the vice-president. The same goes for the 12 senators who were not up for election this year.

One bright spot for the president could be the surprise election of senators Bam Aquino and Francis Pangilinan, both from the liberal wing of politics.

Few polls had predicted their wins, which suggest a public desire for politicians outside the Marcos-Duterte feud.

Neither is a friend of the Marcos clan – liberals were the main opposition to the Marcos-Duterte team in the 2022 election.

But they were strongly opposed to the strongman style of former President Duterte, and may fear his pugnacious daughter becoming president in 2028. That may be enough to get them to vote for impeachment.

The impeachment trial is expected to start in July. The Dutertes can be expected to continue chipping away at the president's battered authority in public, and both camps will be lobbying furiously behind the scenes to get senators onto their side.

No president or vice-president has ever been successfully impeached in the Philippines. Nor have any president and vice president ever fallen out so badly.

It is going to be a turbulent year.",2025-05-13T09:30:00Z
US-Israeli hostage reunites with family after being freed by Hamas,"Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander has been reunited with his family in Israel after being held captive by Hamas in Gaza for 19 months.

The 21-year-old had been serving in the Israeli army on the border of Gaza when he was captured by Hamas militants on 7 October 2023.

On Monday, Israel paused its military operations in Gaza for a few hours to facilitate the transfer. A senior Hamas official told the BBC the release was intended as a goodwill gesture and as part of efforts to reach a new ceasefire deal ahead of US President Donald Trump's visit to the Middle East on Tuesday.

Mr Alexander is thought to be the last US citizen held by Hamas who was still alive.

President Trump offered ""congratulations"" to his family on his release.

Television pictures show Edan Alexander smiling as he embraces his parents and siblings at an Israeli military base.

In a statement, his family thanked the US president but also urged the Israeli government and negotiators to continue working to free the 58 remaining hostages.

Mr Alexander is the first hostage to be freed by Hamas since Israel restarted its military offensive on 18 March, after a two-month ceasefire came to an end.

On Monday, he was seen with masked Hamas fighters as they handed him over to Red Cross workers in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis.

He was then transferred to Israeli authorities in Gaza before being reunited with his family in southern Israel. The Israeli military said it provided a ""safe corridor"" for Mr Alexander's release.

A video shared on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's X account showed Yael Alexander speaking to her son over the phone.

""You are strong. You are protected. You are home,"" she said in the video.

Netanyahu called Mr Alexander's return a ""very moving moment"" - and thanked Trump for his support.

The release had been made possible because of military pressure on Hamas and ""the political pressure exerted by President Trump"", Netanyahu said.

He added that Israel intended to continue with plans to intensify its military actions in Gaza and that there would be no ceasefire.

Hamas had earlier said Mr Alexander's release was intended to facilitate a deal for the entry of humanitarian aid into the enclave.

Israel has blocked the entry of all food, medication and other humanitarian supplies into Gaza for 70 days, which aid agencies say amounts to a policy of starvation and could be a war crime, and renewed its aerial bombardment and other military operations there in mid-March.

Hamas has previously said it will only agree to a deal that includes the end of the war. This has been repeatedly rejected by Netanyahu.

Trump is due to arrive in the Middle East on Tuesday, and Israel has vowed to expand its military offensive against Hamas if no deal is reached by the end of his visit.

Israeli officials have said the plans for their expanded offensive include seizing all of Gaza indefinitely, forcibly displacing Palestinians to the south, and taking over aid distribution with private companies despite opposition from the UN and its humanitarian partners, who say they will not co-operate because it appears to ""weaponise"" aid.

Israel is due to send representatives to Qatar on Tuesday to discuss a proposal on further hostage releases.

Qatar and Egypt said that Mr Alexander's release was an encouraging sign of potential new truce talks.

Born in Tel Aviv but raised in New Jersey, Mr Alexander had been serving in an elite infantry unit on the Gaza border when he was captured by Hamas militants during the 7 October 2003 attack.

About 1,200 people were killed and 251 hostages taken. Some 58 hostages remain, up to 23 of whom are believed to be alive.

Five of the captives held in Gaza are believed to have US citizenship. Mr Alexander is thought to be the last American still alive.

Israel's military campaign has killed 52,829 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, including 2,720 Palestinians killed since March.",2025-05-13T09:30:00Z
"'I've practised being booed', Israel's Eurovision entry who survived Hamas attack tells BBC","Yuval Raphael never dreamt she'd be at Eurovision.

The last major music event she attended was the Nova festival, in Israel, where she was nearly killed. On 7 October 2023, the singer fled the festival when Hamas gunmen started shooting.

Now she's preparing to go on stage at the world's largest music event.

""It's something I deal with every day,"" she told the BBC. ""It feels like a personal win, just to be having this experience and representing my country and doing it with such pride.""

On that day - one and a half years ago - Ms Raphael was attending her first outdoor rave. As rockets were fired from Gaza into Israel, and Hamas gunmen started shooting at revellers, she attempted to flee the carnage.

She and her friends took refuge in a concrete bomb shelter at the side of a road. Around 50 people were crammed in, lying on top of each other.

But there was no escape as the gunmen shot repeatedly into the mass of bodies in the shelter and then threw in hand grenades.

Ms Raphael managed to call her father in tears, as heard in a recording played in an Israeli documentary. ""Dad, lots of people are dead. Send the police here. Please dad, send the police, it's urgent.. they're crushing me,"" she said.

""Be quiet,"" he replied. ""Yuvali my daughter. Yuvali, breathe deep. Hide. Play dead.""

""Bye,"" she said, thinking that was the end.

Ms Raphael was one of only 11 people in the shelter to survive. She hid under a pile of dead bodies for eight hours until they were rescued.

That day, around 1,200 people were killed by gunmen led by Hamas, and 251 were taken hostage.

Ms Raphael's professional singing career started after the attack. ""I wished for myself to be happy and to really understand the gift that I had been given, and that's to live,"" she says. ""To have more experiences, to be happy and to live fully.""

On Thursday, the 24-year-old will sing her song, New Day Will Rise, at the Eurovision semi-final with shrapnel still in her leg.

The rules of the European Broadcasting Union – which is in charge of Eurovision – means no political statements can be made. The singer won't describe what happened to her at Nova during the run-up to the competition. She previously gave testimony about her experience to the United Nations.

The Israeli entrant has had to contend with protests about her country's participation in the song contest.

Irish national broadcaster RTÉ asked the EBU for a discussion on Israel's inclusion. Its director general, Kevin Bakhurst, said he was ""appalled by the ongoing events in the Middle East and by the horrific impact on civilians in Gaza, and the fate of Israeli hostages"". Spain and Slovenia's broadcasters also asked for a discussion.

Last week, more than 70 former Eurovision contestants signed a letter calling on the organisers to ban Israel from the competition.

More than 52,800 people have been killed in Gaza since the 7 October attacks, including 2,700 since the Israeli offensive resumed, according to the territory's health ministry.

In previous years, other countries have been banned from the contest. Belarus was suspended in 2021 after submitting an overtly political entry and a year later Russia was barred over the war in Ukraine.

Ms Raphael said she was trying not to deal with those who say her country shouldn't be competing. ""Everybody has opinions,"" she said. ""I'm really putting everything aside and just concentrating on the most important thing. The slogan this year is 'united by music' and that's what we are here for.""

Eurovision said it understood the concerns and views about the current situation in the Middle East, but insisted members should ensure Eurovision remained a ""universal event that promotes connections, diversity and inclusion through music"".

Nevertheless, Israeli fans have been warned by their country's National Security Council not to wear Jewish or Israeli symbols while attending Eurovision.

On Sunday, during the Eurovision opening parade in the Swiss host city of Basel, the Israeli broadcasting delegation made a complaint to the police and the EBU after accusing a pro-Palestinian demonstrator of making a throat-slitting gesture and spitting at the delegation.

""It was scary at times, even uncomfortable, but it makes me keep reminding myself why I'm here and my agenda, which is spreading as much love as I can and bringing pride to my country,"" Ms Raphael said.

Last year, the Israeli singer Eden Golan, who said she received death threats, was booed as she sang. ""I think I'm expecting it,"" admitted Ms Raphael, when she was asked if she too anticipated booing. ""But we are here to sing and I'm going to sing my heart out for everyone.""

She said they had done a few rehearsals with sounds in the background so she could practise with distractions. Asked if that was upsetting, she told the BBC she had a lot of emotions she was putting aside to stay focused.

""I really think I have a lot of weight on my shoulders, I have a very big responsibility. I have a lot of people at home that are expecting something.""",2025-05-13T09:30:00Z
Gérard Depardieu found guilty in sexual assault trial,"French film star Gérard Depardieu has been found guilty of sexual assaulting two women on a film set at a trial in Paris and given a suspended jail term of 18 months.

The 76-year-old actor was accused by the two women of groping them during work on a film in 2021. Depardieu had denied the allegations against him and his lawyer said he would appeal.

The court in Paris found that one of the women, a set designer named Amélie, had given consistent evidence while the actor's accounts had changed over time. She told reporters afterwards she was ""very moved"" and satisfied with the verdict, which for her was a victory.

Depardieu has also been convicted of assaulting an assistant director, called Sarah.

The actor was not in court to hear the verdict but was instead working on a film set in the Azores.

Carine Durrieu-Diebolt, the lawyer acting for the two women, said she hoped the verdict marked the end of impunity for an artist in the film industry.

""It's a victory for two women on a film set but it's a victory for all the women behind this case and I'm thinking of all of Depardieu's other victims,"" she told reporters.

The lawyer also noted the case had come to an end hours before the Cannes film festival was due to start.

The alleged assaults took place in September 2021 when Depardieu was making a film called Les Volets Verts (The Green Shutters) about an ageing actor coming to terms with his declining powers.

This was Depardieu's first trial on sexual assault charges. Several other women have made similar allegations in the media, and an alleged rape case could come to trial in the future.

At the end of the trial in Paris in late March, prosecutor Laurent Guy said: ""It's perfectly possible to be an excellent actor and a great father - and still commit a crime.

""You are not here to pass judgment on French cinema. You are here to judge Gérard Depardieu, just as you would any other citizen.""

The prosecutor had asked for a suspended prison term of 18 months, as well as a €20,000 (£16,850) fine and registration on the sex-offenders' list.

Claude Vincent, representing one of the two women plaintiffs, described Depardieu as a ""misogynist"" and a ""case-study in sexism"".

But for the defence, Jérémie Assous demanded an acquittal and called the plaintiffs' team ""more militants than lawyers"".

""They cannot bear that there should even be a defence. They think any defence is a supplementary assault,"" he told the court.

The first plaintiff - a set decorator called Amélie - told the court that after a minor argument with Depardieu, he caught her between his legs and held her by the hips.

The second woman - an assistant director called Sarah - said the actor touched her buttocks and breasts through her clothes on three separate occasions.

Depardieu denied the allegations, saying only that he might have touched the women accidentally or to keep his balance.

At the end of the hearings, Depardieu said: ""My name has been dragged through the mud by lies and insults.

""A trial can be a very special experience for an actor. Seeing all this anger, the police, the press. It's like being in a science fiction film, except it's not science fiction. It's life.""

He thanked the prosecution and defence teams for giving him insights into how courts operate. ""These lessons may be an inspiration for me one day if I get to play a lawyer,"" he said.

Depardieu said he had not worked as an actor for three years since the sexual allegations against him began to circulate.

However earlier this month it was reported that he had begun work in the Azores on a film directed by his friend, the actress Fanny Ardant. Depardieu is playing a magician on a mysterious island, according to media reports.

Ardant appeared with Depardieu in Les Volets Verts and spoke in his defence at the trial.

""Genius - in whatever form it takes - carries within it an element of the extravagant, the untamed, the dangerous. (Depardieu) is the monster and the saint,"" she said.

Another veteran French actress took Depardieu's side on Monday. In a rare interview with French television, Brigitte Bardot, 90, deplored how ""talented people who touch the buttocks of a girl are consigned to the deepest dungeon.""

""Feminism isn't my thing,"" Bardot said. ""Personally, I like men.""",2025-05-13T09:30:00Z
Arrest over suspected arson on property linked to Keir Starmer,"Police have arrested a man over suspected arson attacks on two properties linked to Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, and a car.

The 21-year-old was arrested on suspicion of arson with intent to endanger life and remains in custody, Metropolitan Police said.

Emergency services responded to a fire at the prime minister's private home in Kentish Town, north London, early on Monday.

On Sunday, first responders were called to a small fire at the front door of a house converted into flats in nearby Islington, a property also linked to Sir Keir.

One person was helped to safety by firefighters, London Fire Brigade said.

Police are also looking at a small car fire, on the same street as the Kentish Town property, on Thursday as part of the investigation.

Counter-terrorism police are leading the inquiry and are treating the fires as suspicious.

""As a precaution and due to the property having previous connections with a high-profile public figure, officers from the Met's Counter Terrorism Command are leading the investigation into this fire,"" the Metropolitan Police said.

The car fire occurred just before 03:00 BST on Thursday.

One neighbour told BBC News: ""I heard people screaming 'fire, fire!' I looked out and you could see it lighting up the street.""

The first fire at a property was reported in Islington on Sunday just after 03:00.

The second property fire took place in Kentish Town on Monday at 01:11. The small fire was under control about 20 minutes later.

There was damage to the property's entrance but nobody was hurt, the police said.

Sir Keir is understood to still own the home, but lives at Downing Street.

He lived in the home before the 2024 general election and it has been rented out since then.

On Monday, Sir Keir thanked the emergency services for their work, his official spokesman said.

He added the matter was ""subject to a live investigation so I can't comment further"", and declined to provide any further details on who was in the property when the fire started.

Home Secretary Yvette Cooper told the BBC she had been briefed on the incidents but could not comment further.

""Police are investigating these incidents and they have my full support in doing so,"" she said.

""With any incident, there are always the important concerns that all of us will have, but we also have confidence in our police and the work that they are doing to investigate this incident.""

Gaza photojournalist Hassan Aslih killed in Israeli strike on hospital,"An Israeli air strike on the emergency department of Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza has killed a well-known Palestinian photojournalist, medical sources and eyewitnesses say.

Hassan Aslih, who was being treated for injuries from a previous Israeli strike, was targeted in what witnesses described as a drone attack on the hospital's surgical wing.

A doctor there confirmed that Aslih had been at the hospital for nearly a month after surviving an air strike on the same facility in April.

The Israeli military had previously accused Aslih of involvement in the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel. The strike in April killed Aslih's colleague Helmi al-Faqawi and wounded several other journalists.

At the time, Ismail al-Thawabta, director of the Hamas-run government media office, said Israel's accusations against Aslih were ""false"", adding that Aslih had no political affiliation.

""The occupation's claim that Aslih crossed into the occupied land and took part in the 7 October incidents is part of a policy to discredit and fabricate that the occupation adopts to justify attacks on journalists and media personnel,"" Thawabta told Reuters agency on 7 April.

Aslih had published dozens of photos and videos documenting the 7 October Hamas assault from inside Israeli territory.

Aslih worked for years as a freelance photojournalist with both international and local news agencies. He was widely respected in Gaza for his extensive coverage of the conflict, often documenting events from the front lines. He has more than half a million followers on Instagram, where he documents the war.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement it had attacked Nasser Hospital in what it said was ""a targeted attack on key terrorists"", but did not name Aslih.

It said the hospital was being used by Hamas to ""carry out terrorist plots against Israeli forces and citizens"".

The Israeli military has repeatedly attacked what it claims are Hamas command-and-control centres based in hospitals or gunmen sheltering there. Hamas denies using hospitals in this way.

The UN's human rights office has condemned what it calls Israel's ""pattern of deadly attacks on and near hospitals in Gaza"", saying they could amount to war crimes or crimes against humanity.

The Israel-Gaza war is the deadliest conflict for journalists in history, according to Brown University's Watson Institute for Public Affairs, with more than 232 journalists killed in Gaza since the 7 October attacks.",2025-05-13T09:30:00Z
Rapper Tory Lanez stabbed 14 times in California prison attack,"Rapper Tory Lanez has been rushed to hospital after he was stabbed 14 times in a California prison.

The Canadian hip-hop artist was attacked by another inmate on Monday morning in a housing unit at the California Correctional Institution in Tehachapi, about 75 miles (120km) north of Los Angeles, prison officials told the BBC.

The 32-year-old rapper suffered wounds across his body - causing both of his lungs to collapse, according to a post on his Instagram account.

Lanez, whose legal name is Daystar Peterson, is serving a 10-year prison sentence for shooting fellow musician Megan Thee Stallion in 2020.

The star's Instagram post said he was stabbed in the back, torso, head and face. He was temporarily placed on a breathing apparatus but is now able to breathe on his own, the Instagram post adds.

""Despite being in pain, he is talking normally, in good spirits, and deeply thankful to God that he is pulling through,"" the post said.

The attack happened around 07:20 local time (15:20 GMT), said Pedro Calderón Michel of the state's corrections department.

Prison staff began first aid before Lanez was taken to a local medical facility for further treatment, he said.

An investigation is underway into the stabbing, Mr Calderón Michel told the BBC. He did not comment on the attacker's motive.

Lanez was sentenced in 2023 for three felony gun-related charges, including assault with a semi-automatic firearm.

He shot Megan Thee Stallion, whose legal name is Megan Pete, as they were leaving a pool party at reality star Kylie Jenner's Hollywood mansion.

The pair argued inside a vehicle about their previous sexual relationship and careers, Megan Thee Stallion testified during the trial.

She said that she had demanded to be let out of the vehicle, at which point Lanez started shooting at the ground and shouted at her to ""dance"".

She required surgery to remove bullet fragments from her foot.

Lanez refused to apologise and maintained his innocence in the shooting.

The case divided the hip-hop world with rappers - including 50 Cent and Iggy Azalea -  appearing to take sides in the conflict. Some of them wrote to the court to ask for leniency in Lanez's sentencing.

Lanez had seven US top 10 albums in the seven years before his conviction. He has teased the release of a new album from prison titled Peterson.",2025-05-13T09:30:00Z
"Russia responsible for downing of MH17, UN body rules","Russia was responsible for the downing of the Malaysia Airlines flight, MH17, over eastern Ukraine in July 2014, the United Nations aviation agency has ruled.

All 298 people on board the passenger plane were killed when it was shot down by a Russian-made missile.

The Kremlin has always denied any responsibility for the air disaster.

On Monday, the UN's Council of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) voted that the Russian Federation failed to uphold its obligations under international air law, which requires states to ""refrain from resorting to the use of weapons against civil aircraft in flight"".

Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was travelling from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur when it was struck down over the Donbas region of Ukraine, during a conflict between pro-Russian rebels and Ukrainian forces.

The majority of passengers and crew, 196 people, were from the Netherlands.

There were also 38 people from Australia, 10 British citizens, as well as Belgian and Malaysian nationals on board.

The case to the UN was brought in 2022 by the Australian and Dutch governments, who have both welcomed the ICAO's ruling.

""We call upon Russia to finally face up to its responsibility for this horrific act of violence and make reparations for its egregious conduct"", said Australia's foreign minister Penny Wong in a statement.

The Dutch foreign minister, Caspar Veldkamp, said it marked an ""important step towards establishing the truth and achieving justice and accountability"".

It sends a clear messaged to the international community, he added: ""states cannot violate international law with impunity"" .

In 2022, a Dutch court ruled that a Russian-controlled group had downed the plane and two Russians and a pro-Moscow Ukrainian national were convicted of murder in absentia.

The trio were all sentenced to life in prison however, as they were not extradited, they have not served time in jail.

"Gold is booming – but how safe is it for investors, really?","Listen to Theo read this article

""What you have there is about £250,000 worth of gold,"" Emma Siebenborn says as she shows me a faded plastic tub filled with old, shabby jewellery - rings, charm bracelets, necklaces and orphaned earrings.

Emma is the strategies director of Hatton Garden Metals, a family-run gold dealership in London's Hatton Garden jewellery district, and this unprepossessing tub of bric-a-brac is a small sample of what they buy over the counter each day. It is, in effect, gold scrap, which will be melted down and recycled.

Also on the table, rather more elegantly presented in a suede-lined tray, is a selection of gold coins and bars. The largest bar is about the size and thickness of a mobile phone. It weighs a hefty 1kg, and it's worth about £80,000.

The coins include biscuit-sized Britannias, each containing precisely one ounce of 24 carat bullion, as well as smaller Sovereigns. These are all available to buy - and the recent surge in gold prices has led to a surge in demand.

Zoe Lyons, who is Emma's sister and the managing director, has never seen anything like it – often she finds would-be sellers queuing in the street. ""There's excitement and buzz in the market but also nervousness and trepidation,"" she tells me.

""There's anxiety about which way the market is going to go next, and when you get those emotions, ultimately it creates quite big trades.""

At MNR jewellers a couple of streets away, a salesman agrees: ""Demand for gold has increased, definitely,"" he says.

Gold is certainly on a roll. Its price has increased by more than 40% over the past year. In late April it rose above $3,500 (£2,630) per troy ounce (a measurement for precious metals). This marked an all-time record, even allowing for inflation, exceeding the previous peak reached in January 1980. Back then the dollar price was $850, or $3,493 in today's money.

Economists have attributed this to a variety of factors. Principal among them has been the unpredictable changes in US trade policy, introduced by the Trump administration, the effects of which have shaken the markets. Gold, by contrast, is seen by many as a solid investment. Fears about geopolitical uncertainty have only added to its allure. Many investors have come to appreciate the relative stability offered by a commodity once dismissed by the billionaire Warren Buffett as ""lifeless"" and ""neither of much use nor procreative"".

""It's the kind of conditions that we consider a bit of a perfect storm for gold,"" explains Louise Street, senior markets analyst at the World Gold Council, a trade association funded by the mining industry.

""It's the focus on potential inflationary pressures. Recessionary risks are rising, you've seen the IMF [International Monetary Fund] downgrading economic forecasts very recently…""

But what goes up can also come down. While gold has a reputation as a stable asset, it is not immune to price fluctuations. In fact, in the past, major surges in the price have been followed by significant falls.

So what is the risk this could happen again, leaving many of today's eager investors nursing big losses?

Helped by its relative rarity, gold has been seen as an intrinsic store of value for centuries. The global supply is limited. Only around 216,265 tonnes have ever been mined, according to the World Gold Council, (the total is currently increasing by about 3,500 tonnes per year). This means that it is widely perceived as a ""safe haven"" asset that will retain its value.

As an investment, however, it has both advantages and disadvantages.

Unlike shares, it will never pay a dividend. Unlike bonds, it will not provide a steady, predictable income, and its industrial applications are relatively limited.

The draw, however, is that it is a physical product that exists outside of the banking system. It is also used as an insurance policy against inflation: while currencies tend to lose value over time, gold does not.

""Gold can't be printed by central banks, and it can't be conjured out of thin air,"" says Russ Mould, investment director at stockbroker AJ Bell. ""In recent times, a big policy response from authorities when there's been a crisis has been: slash interest rates, boost money supply, quantitative easing, print money. Gold is seen as a haven from that, and therefore a store of value.""

There has recently been a significant rise in demand for gold from so-called Exchange Traded Funds, investment vehicles that hold an asset such as gold themselves, while investors can buy and sell shares in the fund.

They are popular with large institutional investors – and their actions have helped to push up the price.

When gold hit its previous record in January 1980, the Soviet Union had just invaded Afghanistan. Oil prices were surging, driving up inflation in developed economies, and investors were looking to protect their wealth. The price also rose sharply in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, leading to another peak in 2011.

The recent increases appear to owe a great deal to the way markets have responded to the confusion triggered by the Trump administration.

The most recent surge came after US President Donald Trump launched an online attack on Jerome Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve. Calling for immediate interest rate cuts, he described Mr Powell as a ""major loser"" for failing to reduce the cost of borrowing quickly enough.

His comments were interpreted by some as an attack on the independence of the US central bank. Share markets fell, as did the value of the dollar compared to other major currencies – and gold hit its most recent record.

But gold's recent strength is not wholly explained by the Trump factor.

The price has been on a steep upward curve since late 2022, partly, according to Louise Street, because of central banks. ""[They] have been net buyers of gold, to add to their official reserves, for the past 15 years,"" she explains. ""But we saw that really accelerate in the past three years.""

Central banks have collectively bought more than 1,000 tonnes of gold each year since 2022, up from an average of 481 tonnes a year between 2010 and 2021. Poland, Turkey, India, Azerbaijan and China were among the leading buyers last year.

Analysts say central banks may themselves have been trying to build up buffers at a time of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty.

According to Daan Struyven, co-head of global commodities research at Goldman Sachs: ""In 2022 the reserves of the Russian Central Bank got frozen in the context of the invasion of Ukraine, and reserve managers of global central banks around the world realised, 'Maybe my reserves aren't safe either, what if I buy gold and hold it in my own vaults?'

""And so we have seen this big structural fivefold increase in demand for gold from central banks"".

Simon French, chief economist and head of research at investment firm Panmure Liberum also believes that independence from dollar-based banking systems has been a major driver for central banks. ""I would look at China, but also Russia, their central bank is a big buyer of gold, also Turkey.

""There are a number of countries who fear weaponisation of the dollar system and potentially the Euro system,"" he says.

""If they are not aligning themselves with the US or the Western view, on diplomatic grounds, on military grounds… having an asset in their central bank that is not controlled by their military or political foes is quite an attractive feature.""

Another factor may now be helping to drive the gold market upwards: FOMO, or fear of missing out. With new all-time records being set, it has filtered through into everyday conversation in some quarters.

Zoe Lyons believes that this is the case in Hatton Garden. ""[People] want a piece of the golden pie,"" she says, ""and they're willing to do that through buying physical gold.""

The big question, though, is what happens next. Some experts believe the upward trend will continue, fuelled by unpredictable US policy, inflationary pressures and central bank buying. Indeed Goldman Sachs has forecast gold will reach $3,700/oz (£2,800/oz) by the end of 2025 and $4,000 (£3,000) by mid 2026.

But it adds that in the event of a recession in the US or an escalation of the trade war it could even hit $4,500 (£3,400) later this year.

""The US stock market is 200 times bigger than the gold market, so even a small move out of the big stock market or the big bond market would mean a big percent increase in the much smaller gold market,"" explains Daan Struyven.

In other words, it wouldn't take a huge amount of turbulence in major investment markets to drive gold upwards.

Yet others are concerned that the price of gold has risen so far, so fast that a market bubble is forming – and bubbles can burst.

Back in 1980, for example, the dramatic spike in the gold price was followed by an equally remarkable correction, dropping from $850 (£640) in late January to just $485 (£365) in early April. By mid-June the following year, it stood at just $297 (£224) – a decline of 65% from its peak.

The peak in 2011, meanwhile, was followed by a sharp dip, then a period of volatility. Within four months it had dropped by 18%. After plateauing for a while, it continued to fall, reaching a low point in mid-2013 that was 35% down from its highest.

The question that remains is, could something similar happen now?

Some analysts do think prices will ultimately fall significantly. Jon Mills, an industry expert at Morningstar, made headlines in March when he suggested the cost of an ounce of gold could drop to just $1,820 over the next few years.

His view was that as mining firms increased their production and more recycled gold entered the market, the supply would increase. At the same time central banks would ease off their buying spree, while other short-term pressures stimulating demand would subside, bringing prices down.

Those forecasts have since been revised upwards slightly, largely because of increased mining costs.

Daan Struyven disagrees. He believes there could be a short-term dip, but prices will generally continue to rise. ""If we were to get a Ukraine peace deal, or a rapid trade de-escalation, I think hedge funds would be willing to take some of their money out of gold and put it into risky assets, such as the stock market…

""So you could see temporary dips. But we are quite confident that in this highly uncertain geopolitical setup, where central banks want safer reserve holdings, that they will continue to push demand higher over the medium term.""

Russ Mould believes there will, at the very least, be a lull in the upwards trend. ""Given that it has had such a stunning run, it would be logical to expect it to have a pause for breath at some stage,"" he says.

But he believes that if there is a sharp economic slowdown and interest rates are slashed, the gold price could go higher in the long run.

One problem for investors is working out whether the recent record price for gold was simply a staging point in a continued upward climb – to more than $4,000 for example – or the peak.

Simon French at Panmure Liberum believes the peak may now be very close, and people piling into the market now in the hope of making big money are likely to be disappointed. Others have warned that those recently lured into buying gold by hype and headlines could lose out if the market goes into reverse.

""Short-term speculating can backfire, even though there will be a temptation to hang on to the coat-tails of the record run upwards,"" is how Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, has put it.

""Investors considering investing in gold should do so as part of a diversified portfolio – they shouldn't put all their eggs in a golden basket.""

Why the mighty Himalayas are getting harder and harder to see,"I grew up in Nepal's capital watching the Himalayas. Ever since I left, I've missed sweeping, panoramic views of some of the highest mountain peaks on Earth.

Each time I visit Kathmandu, I hope to catch a glimpse of the dramatic mountain range. But these days, there's usually no luck.

The main culprit is severe air pollution that hangs as haze above the region.

And it's happening even during the spring and autumn months, which once offered clear skies.

Just last April, the international flight I was in had to circle in the sky nearly 20 times before landing in Kathmandu, because of the hazy weather impacting visibility at the airport.

The hotel I checked in at was at a reasonable height from which mountains are visible on a clear day – but there was no such day during my two-week stay.

Even from the major vantage point of Nagarkot, just outside Kathmandu, all that could be seen was haze, as if the mountains did not exist.

""I no longer brand the place for views of 'sunrise, sunset and Himalayas' as I did in the past,"" said Yogendra Shakya, who has been operating a hotel at Nagarkot since 1996.

""Since you can't have those things mostly now because of the haze, I have rebranded it with history and culture as there are those tourism products as well here.""

During an earlier trip a year ago, I was hopeful I would be able to see the mighty Himalayan peaks on a trek in the mesmerising Annapurna region – but had hardly any luck there either.

Scientists say hazy conditions in the region are becoming increasingly intense and lasting longer, reducing visibility significantly.

Haze is formed by a combination of pollutants like dust and smoke particles from fires, reducing visibility to less than 5,000m (16,400ft). It remains stagnant in the sky during the dry season - which now lasts longer due to climate change.

June to September is the region's rainy season, when Monsoon clouds rather than haze keep the mountains covered and visibility low.

Traditionally, March to May and October to November were the best times for business because that was when skies remained clear and visibility was best.

But with rising temperatures and a lack of rain, and worsening air pollution, the spring months are now seeing thick haze with low visibility. Those conditions are beginning as early as December.

Lucky Chhetri, a pioneering female trekking guide in Nepal, said hazy conditions had led to a 40% decrease in business.

""In one case last year, we had to compensate a group of trekkers as our guides could not show them the Himalayas due to the hazy conditions,"" she added

An Australian tourist who has visited Nepal more than a dozen times since 1986 described not seeing the mountains as a ""major let-down"".

""It wasn't like this 10 years ago but now the haze seems to have taken over and it is extraordinarily disappointing for visitors like me,"" said John Carrol.

Krishna Acharya, the provincial chair of the Trekking Agents Association of Nepal in the western Gandaki province, says the trekking industry is in deep trouble.

""Our member trekking operators are getting depressed because no sighting of the Himalayas means no business. Many of them are even considering changing professions,"" he told the BBC.

On the Indian side, near the central Himalayas, hoteliers and tour operators say haze is now denser and returns quicker than before.

""We have long dry spells and then a heavy downpour, unlike in the past. So with infrequent rain the haze persists for much longer,"" said Malika Virdi, who heads a community-run tourism business in the state of Uttarakhand.

However, Ms Virdi says tourists are persistent - with many who didn't catch the mountain range returning to try their luck again.

The western Himalayas in Pakistan have been relatively less affected by the haze because the mountains are relatively far from cities.

But locals say that even the ranges that were once easily visible from places like Peshawar and Gilgit are often no longer seen.

""The sheet of haze remains hanging for a longer period and we don't see the mountains that we could in the past,"" said Asif Shuja, the former head of Pakistan's environmental protection agency.

South Asian cities regularly top lists of places with highest levels of air pollution in the world.

Public health across the region has been badly impacted by the toxic air, which frequently causes travel disruption and school closures.

Vehicular and industrial emissions, dust from infrastructure construction and dry gravel roads as well as the open burning of waste are major sources of air pollution year-round.

This is compounded by soot from massive forest fires - which are increasing due to a longer dry season - and the burning of crop residues after the harvest by farmers in northern India, Pakistan and Nepal.

Weather conditions keeping warmer air above cooler air trap these pollutants and limit vertical air movement - preventing pollution from dispersing.

""Hazes and dust storms are increasing in South Asia, and this trend is projected to continue due to climate change and other factors,"" Dr Someshwor Das from the South Asia Meteorological Association told the BBC.

In 2024, the number of hazy days recorded at the airport in Pokhara, a major tourism hub in western Nepal, was 168 - up from 23 in 2020 and 84 in 2021, according to Nepal's department of hydrology and meteorology.

Experts believe the Himalayas are probably the worst affected mountain range in the world given their location in a populous and polluted region.

This could mean the scintillating view of the Himalayas could now largely be limited to photographs, paintings and postcards.

""We are left to do business with guilt when we are unable to show our clients the mountains that they pay us for,"" said trekking leader Ms Chhetri.

""And there is nothing we can do about the haze.""

"Diddy used fame and violence to abuse women, trial hears","Sean ""Diddy"" Combs used fame and violence to sexually abuse women, prosecutors have said in opening statements at the hip-hop mogul's trial, while the rapper's attorneys defended his ""swinger"" lifestyle.

The 55-year-old has pleaded not guilty to charges including racketeering, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution.

The court also heard from prosecutors' first witnesses, including a security guard from a hotel where Mr Combs is seen in a now-viral video beating his ex-girlfriend in 2016.

His testimony was followed by a man who said Mr Combs abused his ex-girlfriend during paid sexual encounters with the couple.

Warning: This story contains details that some readers may find distressing.

After seating a panel of 12 jurors and six alternates on Monday morning, the government and Mr Combs' lawyers outlined their cases.

Prosecutor Emily Johnson accused Mr Combs of using his celebrity status and a ""loyal"" inner circle of employees to sexually abuse women and run a criminal enterprise.

She focused on the two central alleged victims in the case - Mr Combs' former girlfriend, Cassandra Ventura, and another unnamed former girlfriend.

Prosecutors told the court that Mr Combs had used violence and threatened Ms Ventura's music career to force her to perform non-consensual, humiliating sexual acts with male prostitutes during so-called ""freak-offs"" filmed by Mr Combs.

The defendant ""had the power to ruin her [Ms Ventura's] life"", Ms Johnson said.

As prosecutors described the allegations against Mr Combs, he sat in a grey sweater and trousers with a blank stare and his hands folded on his lap.

At the heart of the government's case is a surveillance video that shows Mr Combs beating Ms Ventura and dragging her by the hair in a Los Angeles hotel hallway in 2016.

Lawyers for Mr Combs said the video was evidence of Mr Combs' ""flawed"" character, but not of a larger criminal enterprise. ""Domestic violence is not sex trafficking,"" said Teny Geragos, Mr Combs' attorney.

Ms Geragos said Mr Combs has a ""bit of a different sex life"" - and shifted the focus to the women accusing him, calling them ""capable, strong women"" who chose to stay with the rapper.

They had ""the freedom to make the choices that they made"", Ms Geragos argued.

Prosecutors' first witness, a former security guard named Israel Florez, worked at the hotel, the site of a surveillance video showing Mr Combs attacking his ex-girlfriend. The clip, which CNN released last year, was played for jurors on Monday.

Mr Florez told jurors that morning on 5 March 2016 at the InterContinental Hotel in Los Angeles he received a call about a ""woman in distress"" on the sixth floor.

He said he found Mr Combs there in a towel, slouched on a chair with a ""devilish"" look on his face, and a broken vase on the floor. Ms Ventura sat cowering in the corner with her face covered, Mr Florez said.

Mr Florez told prosecutors that Ms Ventura kept saying she wanted to leave, but Mr Combs told her she could not.

He testified that Ms Ventura had a purple eye, but did not want to call police and she eventually left in a black SUV.

Mr Florez alleged that later, to ""make it go away"", Mr Combs tried to hand him a wad of cash, but he declined.

Attorneys for Mr Combs tried to poke holes in Mr Florez's claims, asking why he did not include certain details - like Ms Ventura's purple eye  - in an incident report he filed afterwards.

His testimony was followed by Daniel Phillip, a former manager of male strippers, who said he met Mr Combs and Ms Ventura after his boss asked him to fill in as a stripper for a bachelorette party.

But, Mr Phillip said, he was greeted at a hotel instead by Ms Ventura, who told him it was her birthday and her husband wanted to give her a gift.

Mr Phillip told the court he would go on to have sex with Ms Ventura on several occasions - encounters that lasted as long as 10 hours, sometimes under the influence of drugs - as Mr Combs watched and filmed.

He alleged that he witnessed Mr Combs attack Ms Ventura at least twice, including one time when he dragged her by her hair as she screamed ""I'm sorry"".

Mr Combs then came back in the room with Ms Ventura and asked the two to have sex again in front of him, Mr Phillip said.

""I was shocked,"" he said. ""It came out of nowhere. I was terrified.""

Mr Phillip claimed on the stand that he did not call the police for fear that Mr Combs was ""someone with unlimited power"" and that he could ""lose his life"" for reporting it.

The trial is scheduled to continue on Tuesday when Ms Ventura is expected to testify.

At the crowded courthouse on Monday, Mr Combs' children - including his daughters - were seen holding hands. His mother also was photographed walking out of court along with his publicist.",2025-05-13T09:30:00Z
Trump's mediation offer on Kashmir puts India in a tight spot,"For decades, if there's one thing that's been a taboo in the Indian foreign ministry, it is third-party mediation - particularly in the long-running dispute with Pakistan over Kashmir.

Those in the know, then, are not surprised that US President Donald Trump - known for his unorthodox diplomacy - has touched a raw nerve in Delhi.

On Saturday, he took to social media to announce that India and Pakistan - after four tense days of cross-border clashes - had agreed to a ""full and immediate ceasefire"", brokered by the US.

Later, in another post he said: ""I will work with you both to see if, after a thousand years, a solution can be arrived at, concerning Kashmir.""

The Kashmir dispute dates back to 1947, when India got independence from British rule and was partitioned to create Pakistan. Both neighbours claim the Kashmir region in whole, but administer it only in part.

Several rounds of bilateral talks over the decades have not yielded any resolution. India treats Kashmir as an integral part of its territory and rules out any negotiation, particularly through a third party.

The latest flare-up began after India carried out air strikes on what it called terrorist infrastructure inside Pakistan in the aftermath of the attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir last month, killing 26 people, mainly tourists.

India blames Pakistan of involvement in the incident, a charge denied by Islamabad.

Trump's intervention came as fighting between the two nuclear-armed rivals was threatening to spiral into a full-blown conflict.

The two sides were using fighter jets, missiles and drones and said they were targeting each other's military installations, mainly in the border areas.

While US mediators, alongside diplomatic backchannels, prevented a bigger conflagration, President Trump's offer has put Delhi in a spot.

""Obviously, it would not be welcome by the Indian side. It goes against our stated position for many years,"" Shyam Saran, a former Indian foreign secretary, tells the BBC.

Islamabad, on the other hand, has welcomed Trump's comments.

""We also appreciate President Trump's expressed willingness to support efforts aimed at the resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute - a longstanding issue that has serious implications for peace and security in South Asia and beyond,"" a  foreign ministry statement said..

Delhi's position on Kashmir has hardened, especially after it withdrew the special status of Jammu and Kashmir in 2019, triggering widespread protests in Kashmir.

President Trump's recent comments have irked many Indians, who see this as an attempt to ""internationalise"" the Kashmir dispute.

The main opposition Congress party wanted an explanation from the government and an all-party meeting on the ""ceasefire announcements made from Washington DC first"".

""Have we opened the doors to third-party mediation? The Indian National Congress would like to ask if diplomatic channels between India and Pakistan are being reopened,"" said the Congress party spokesman Jairam Ramesh.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio's statement announcing the ceasefire also said that the two countries have also agreed ""to start talks on a broad set of issues at a neutral site"". This has caught the Indians by surprise.

Delhi has refused to hold discussions with Islamabad, accusing its neighbour of supporting what it calls cross-border terrorism.

Historically, India has opposed any third-party mediation, quoting an agreement signed in 1972 after a war between the two countries a year earlier. As per the Simla agreement signed by the country's leaders, they ""resolved to settle their differences by peaceful means through bilateral negotiations"".

Indian officials also argue that even when they reach an understanding with a civilian government in Pakistan, the country's powerful military launched operations undermining those deals. They point to the Kargil war in 1999, when another conflict between the two countries began after a group of Pakistan-backed militants occupied strategic areas in Indian-administered Kashmir.

The conflict took place months after the then Indian and Pakistani prime ministers agreed to resolve issues through bilateral negotiations and refrain from interfering in each other's internal matters.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has not formally responded to President Trump's offer to mediate.

But Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said: ""India has consistently maintained a firm and uncompromising stance against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. It will continue to do so.""

It is being seen as an indication that India may not be restarting direct bilateral talks soon.

The view from Pakistan is different.

""Pakistan has always wanted third-party mediation in the Kashmir issue in the absence of mutual trust between the two countries,"" Imtiaz Gul, the executive director of Centre for Research and Security Studies in Islamabad, tells the BBC.

""Now a superpower is willing to stick its neck out. Pakistan will see this as a moral victory,"" Mr Gul says.

Pakistani strategic experts like Syed Muhammad Ali argue it is because of India's consistent refusal to engage with Pakistan that the international community should step in to avoid any future conflict.

""Kashmir is one of the most critical issues for the international community. The recent rapid escalation proves that the sabre-rattling can go out of hand,"" Mr Ali says.

India's assertive diplomacy, particularly since Modi took over in 2014, has been seen as a sign of its confidence as a rising global economic power.

But it will have to pull off a tough balancing act, to stave off Trump's advances.

The US has courted India in recent years as a bulwark against an increasingly assertive China. India is a key member of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue group (Quad), along with the US, Australia and Japan, that was formed to counter Chinese expansionism in the Indo-Pacific.

In recent decades, Washington has also sold modern transport planes, helicopters and other military equipment to Delhi, which is keen to modernise its 1.4 million strong military, that relies heavily on Russian weaponry.

The previous American administrations were aware of India's sensitivities towards the Kashmir issue and largely stayed away from interfering with it. But with Trump, there's a question mark over whether that position still holds.

The US is the largest trading partner of India with bilateral trade reaching about $130bn (£98bn) in 2024. Modi's government is currently negotiating a trade deal with Washington to avoid tariffs.

Delhi will have to walk a fine line. It will be averse to taking up Trump's offer to mediate,  or see the US-brokered ceasefire, or ""understanding"" as it calls it, going beyond the current military tensions. But it's also keen to have a favourable trading relationship with the US.

Any attempt to broaden the talks - on contentious bilateral issues like the now suspended river water-sharing treaty or the status of Kashmir - will invite strong criticism at the domestic level, a trap that Modi is well aware of.",2025-05-13T09:30:00Z
Scepticism and cautious hope as PKK takes historic step to disband,"After 40 years, with 40,000 people killed, and without securing a Kurdish homeland, the banned Kurdistan Workers Party, the PKK, is ending its war against the Turkish state.

This signals the end of one of the longest conflicts in the world - a historic moment for Turkey, its Kurdish minority, and neighbouring countries into which the conflict has spilled over.

A spokesman for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's ruling party said it was an important step towards a country free of terror.

But what will the PKK get for disarming and disbanding? So far the government has made no promises – publicly at least.

Sheltering inside a tea shop from a sudden violent hail storm that battered the ancient city of Diyabakir, Necmettin Bilmez, 65, a driver, was sceptical about what might follow.

""They [the government] have been tricking us for thousands of years,"" he said.

""When I get an ID card in my pocket saying I am Kurdish, I will believe everything will be solved. Otherwise, I don't believe in this.""

Sitting nearby on a small woven stool, Mehmet Ek, 80, had a different view.

""This has come late,"" he said.

""I wish it had happened ten years ago. But still anyone from any side who will stop this bloodshed, I salute them,"" he said, tipping the top of his flat cap.

""This conflict is brother on brother. The one who dies in the mountains [PKK] is ours and the soldier [from the government] is ours.

""We are all losing, Turks and Kurds.""

He wants an amnesty for PKK fighters – like many here - and the release of jailed Kurdish politicians.

""If all that happens it will be a beautiful peace,"" he said.

In this majority Kurdish city in south-eastern Turkey - the de facto Kurdish capital - we found a muted response to PKK's announcement.

The city has been scarred and reshaped by the conflict.

Turkish forces and the PKK battled in the heart of Diyarbakir in 2015. You can still see the rubble of buildings flattened by the Turkish army.

Many local people told us they welcomed peace, or the idea of it, and wanted no more deaths - Turkish or Kurdish.

""No one has achieved anything,"" said Ibrahim Nazlican, 63, drinking tea in the shade of the towering city walls, which have guarded Diyarbakir since Roman times.

""There is nothing but harm and loss, on this side and on that side. There are no winners.""

The conflict has ranged from the mountains of northern Iraq – which became PKK headquarters in recent years - to Turkey's biggest cities.

Outside an Istanbul football stadium in 2016, a PKK affiliate carried out a double bombing killing 38 police officers and 8 civilians. Many Kurds and Turks are hoping this is the end of a dark chapter, which has claimed 40,000 lives

The PKK decision lay down its arms followed a call in February by its jailed leader, Abdullah Ocalan, who said there was ""no alternative to democracy"".

For now, the 76-year-old remains in his cell in an island prison off of Istanbul, where he has been held since 1999.

To his supporters, he remains a heroic figure who has put their cause on a global agenda. They want him released.

LISTEN: The Global Jigsaw on The Kurdish issue

Menice, 47, is among them. She insisted his release was the key to a new dawn for the Kurds, who account for up to 20% of the Turkish population.

""We want peace, but if our leader is not free, we will never be free,"" she said.

""If he is free, we will all be free and the Kurdish problem will be solved.""

She is surrounded by family photos of loved ones who have died fighting for the PKK - which is classed as a terrorist organisation by Turkey, the UK, the US and the EU.

She has lost five relatives including her brother and her oldest son Zindan.

He joined the PKK at 17, and was dead at 25, killed in a Turkish airstrike three years ago.

Menice's eyes fill with tears as she tells us how he used to help her with the housework.

His path may have been mapped out from birth.

""We named him Zindan [meaning cell] because his father was in prison when he was born,"" she told us.

One large photograph hangs on the wall shows Zindan alongside his brother, Berxwendan, who followed his footsteps ""up the mountain"" to the PKK, when he reached the age of 17.

Berxwenden is now 23. His mother did not know if he was alive or dead until he sent his family a photo of himself during Ramadan in March.

Menice is hoping her surviving son may now come back.

""I hope Berxwendan and his friends will come home. As a mother, I want peace. Let there be no killings. Hasn't there been enough suffering for everyone?""

But does she believe that there can be peace between Turkey and the Kurds?

""I believe in us, in Ocalan, and our nation [the Kurds],"" she said firmly.

""The enemy [the Turkish authorities] has forced us not to believe in them.""

However, pro-Kurdish political parties have some leverage.

Erdogan needs their support to enable him to run for a third term as president in elections due in 2028.

For its part, the PKK has been hit hard by the Turkish military in recent years with leaders and fighters hunted down in drone warfare.

And regional change, in Iran and Syria, means the militant group and its affiliates have less freedom to operate.

Both sides have their reasons for doing a deal now. That may be grounds for hope.",2025-05-13T09:30:00Z
Stars hit the Cannes Film Festival: Five things to look out for,"Scarlett Johansson, Jennifer Lawrence and Tom Cruise are among the Hollywood stars who are expected to hit the red carpet at this year's Cannes Film Festival, which starts on Tuesday.

Cannes is one of the most prestigious festivals in the film calendar, and gives premieres to productions that often go on to earn awards and acclaim.

Here are five things to keep a critical eye out for on the French Riviera.

In recent years, Cannes has re-established itself as the main launchpad for award contenders.

Anora won the Palme d'Or at Cannes last May before going on to win best picture at the this year's Oscars. Four of the last five Palme d'Or winners have been nominated for best picture.

This year's jury is led by French screen star Juliette Binoche and includes fellow actors Halle Berry and Jeremy Strong.

Contenders for the Palme d'Or this year include Scottish director Lynne Ramsay's adaptation of Ariana Harwicz's novel Die My Love, which stars Lawrence and Robert Pattinson.

English actor Josh O'Connor - known for portraying a tennis player in Challengers and Prince Charles in The Crown - stars in two films in competition, including The History of Sound opposite Paul Mescal, and The Mastermind, playing an amateur art thief.

Wes Anderson's new film The Phoenician Scheme has the most star-studded line-up at Cannes this year, with Johansson, Benicio Del Toro, Tom Hanks and Benedict Cumberbatch all featuring, as well as Riz Ahmed, Bryan Cranston and Richard Ayoade.

Joaquin Phoenix and Emma Stone appear in Eddington, a pandemic-era dark comedy Western from Ari Aster.

Director Richard Linklater's Nouvelle Vague is described as telling the story of the making of Jean Luc Godard's 1960 classic Breathless, in the same style and spirit as the original.

Black Widow star Johansson has stepped behind the camera and will premiere her directorial debut, Eleanor the Great, about a 94-year-woman who is unexpectedly thrust into the spotlight.

Fellow US actress Kristin Stewart will also bring a film she has directed - The Chronology of Water, adapted from writer Lidia Yuknavitch's memoir of the same name.

Meanwhile, British star Harris Dickinson is another actor moving behind the camera, with Urchin telling the story of a rough sleeper in London who struggles to turn his life around.

Their films will all compete in the festival's secondary Un Certain Regard strand.

Elsewhere, Hollywood legend Robert De Niro will collect the honorary Palme d'Or.

Spike Lee's fifth film with Denzel Washington, Highest 2 Lowest, will get its premiere out of competition. It's a reinterpretation of Japanese film-maker Akira Kurosawa's 1963 crime thriller High and Low, ""played out on the mean streets of modern day New York City"".

Jodie Foster plays a psychiatrist who investigates the apparent murder of one of her patients in Vie Privée (A Private Life), a French-language comedy that is also being screened out of competition.

And Cruise will attend the premiere of the final instalment of Mission: Impossible... should he choose to accept the invitation.

Notable documentaries this year include Put Your Soul On Your Hand And Walk, about Palestinian war photojournalist Fatima Hassouna, who was killed along with her family in an Israeli strike on her home in Gaza last month - on the day after the festival announced its line-up.

The anger over her death has increased interest in the feature.

Another film, Once Upon a Time In Gaza, by Palestinian twins Tarzan and Arab Nasser, will be shown in the Un Certain Regard section.

Other documentaries in the line-up include a hotly-awaited film about WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, The Six-Billion-Dollar Man, which was pulled from the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year.

Meanwhile, a documentary about U2 frontman Bono is also on the festival bill, alongside one about 1984 novelist George Orwell.

The opening day could be overshadowed by the arrival of the verdict in Gerard Depardieu's sexual assault trial.

The international star of French cinema, 76, was found guilty of assaulting two women on a film set in 2021.

The issue of sexual violence in the film industry is a hot topic - a French parliamentary inquiry criticised ""endemic"" abuse last month, while on Monday screen legend Brigitte Bardot defended two accused actors, including Depardieu, saying they should be allowed to ""get on with their lives"".

Those aren't the only external events that will make their presence felt on La Croisette.

Film stars and industry deal-makers may also have a word or two to say on the red carpet about US President Donald Trump's plan to impose 100% tariffs on foreign-made films.

French Culture Minister Rachida Dati recently said the imposition of any such tariffs would lead to ""the American industry being penalised, not ours"".",2025-05-13T09:30:00Z
'I was drugged and raped by my husband for years',"When Kate and her husband sat down one evening to have a chat, she could never have prepared for what he was about to tell her.

""I have been raping you. I've been sedating you and taking photographs of you for years.""

Kate (not her real name) was speechless. She sat there frozen. She couldn't comprehend what he was saying.

""He just told me as if it was, you know: 'We're going to have spaghetti bolognese tomorrow for dinner, is it all right if you pick up the bread?'""

Warning: This story contains descriptions of sexual violence

For years, behind closed doors, her husband had been controlling and abusive. He was violent and misused prescription pills.

There had also been occasions over the years where Kate had woken up to find him having sex with her, something she couldn't consent to, because she was asleep. This was rape.

He would be remorseful afterwards, convincing her that he had been asleep and didn't know what he was doing. He was ill and there must be something wrong with him, he had told her.

Kate supported him in getting help from medical professionals.

But she had no idea at the time that he had been spiking her tea at night with sleeping medication, so he could rape her as she slept.

After his confession, he told her that if she went to the police his life would be over. So she didn't.

This was her children's father. She didn't want to believe that someone she had shared her life with could be capable of wanting to hurt her so badly.

However, over the next few months the horror of what he said he had been doing to her started to have a physical effect.

Kate says she became very ill, her weight plummeted, and she began having panic attacks.

Nearly a year after the confession, during a particularly bad panic attack, Kate told her sister everything.

Her sister called their mother - who called the police. Kate's husband was arrested and questioned.

Four days later, however, Kate contacted Devon and Cornwall Police saying she didn't want to progress with the case.

""I just wasn't ready,"" she says. ""There was a grief. Not just for me, but for the children. Their dad would never be who he was.""

Nevertheless, Kate didn't want her husband in the house any more, and he moved out.

After this, she began to think more clearly about what had happened. Six months later, Kate went back to the police.

An investigation began, led by Det Con Mike Smith.

Kate says the detective helped her understand that she was the survivor of a serious crime: ""He helped give me my power back. I didn't consciously realise that I'd had it taken away. He explained that it was rape.""

Her (now ex-) husband's medical records provided a crucial piece of evidence. After his confession to Kate, he had paid privately to see a psychiatrist.

During the session he described ""drugging his wife in order to have sex with her while she was asleep"". The admission was recorded in the psychiatrist's notes.

Kate says her husband also confessed to some people at Narcotics Anonymous, as well as friends at the church they both attended.

Police files on the case were eventually presented to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) but it decided not to press charges.

Kate couldn't understand why.

""I thought, if you have not got enough evidence in my case to convict, with confessions from the perpetrator, then how does anybody else stand a chance?"" she says.

Devastated, she applied for a formal review of the CPS's decisions. Six months later, the CPS said that her ex-husband would now be charged. It also admitted that ""the original decision taken by our charging prosecutor was flawed"".

""While we get the vast majority of our charging decisions right the first time, this was not the case here and we apologise to the victim for the distress this will have caused,"" a CPS spokesperson told File on 4 Investigates.

The case went to court in 2022, five years after Kate's ex-husband had made his confession to her.

During the trial, he claimed Kate had a sexual fantasy of being tied up in her sleep and woken up in that position to have consensual sex. He admitted drugging her, but said it was so he could tie her up without waking her. He denied that it was so he could rape her, but the jury didn't believe him.

""I saw it as being absolutely preposterous,"" says Det Con Smith. ""This is the most traumatic thing in her life and they were very much painting her as a fully engaged party for some sort of sexual kink.""

After a week-long trial, the ex-husband was found guilty of rape, sexual assault by penetration and administering a substance with intent.

In sentencing, he was described by the judge as ""a self-obsessed person, endlessly prioritising his own perceived needs"", who had shown ""no real personal remorse"".

He was sentenced to 11 years in prison and given a lifelong restraining order.

If you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this story, information and support can be found at the BBC's Action Line.

Three years on, Kate is trying to rebuild her life with her children. She has since been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and a neurological disorder, caused by the trauma she went through.

Kate sees similarities between her case and that of Gisèle Pelicot, the French woman whose ex-husband drugged and raped her, and also recruited dozens of men to abuse her.

""I remember at the time just hoping and praying that she gets the support and the validation that she needs,"" Kate says.

""Chemical control"" is the term now being used for domestic abusers who use medication as a weapon. ""It's probably quite widespread,"" warns Prof Marianne Hester from the University of Bristol's Centre for Gender and Violence Research.

""I always think of it in terms of the abuser's toolkit,"" she says. ""If there are prescription drugs in the house, is the perpetrator actually using them as part of the abuse in some way?""

Offences such as spiking are being under-recorded in part because of changes to how police record crimes, says Dame Nicole Jacobs, the Domestic Abuse Commissioner for England and Wales.

""If ministers want to ensure that the measures they put in place to halve violence against women and girls over the next decade are reducing harm, then we must accurately measure all domestic abuse related crimes reported to the police,"" she says.

""This is critical to not only ensuring perpetrators are held to account, but so that victims get the necessary help they need to rebuild after abuse.""

The Home Office told us that it is developing police software which will be able to identify spiking incidents which occur as part of another crime.

Under the Crime and Policing Bill currently going through Parliament, the government is creating what is described as a new, ""modern"" offence of ""administering a harmful substance, including by spiking"" - to encourage victims to report to police.

Spiking is already a crime throughout the UK, covered by other pieces of legislation - including the 1861 Offences against the Person Act.

Under the new law - to apply in England and Wales - perpetrators will face up to 10 years in jail.

The Ministry of Justice says the creation of a specific offence will help police to keep track of spiking, ""and will encourage more victims... to come forward and report these crimes"".

Jess Phillips - the minister for safeguarding and violence against women and girls - called spiking ""a vile crime that violates victims' confidence and sense of safety"", in a statement to File on 4 Investigates.

Discussions are under way to extend the law to Northern Ireland.

The Scottish government says it has no current plans to create a specific offence but is keeping the situation under review.

Kate eventually received justice. But her ex-husband wouldn't be in prison if she hadn't taken on the CPS when it didn't believe the case showed a realistic chance of conviction.

""I want other people to understand that abuse happens a lot more quietly than you think,"" says Kate. ""I'm still learning properly what happened to me and how that's affected me.""",2025-05-13T09:30:00Z
"Nissan to cut 11,000 more jobs and shut seven factories","Japanese carmaker Nissan has said it will cut another 11,000 jobs globally and shut seven factories as it shakes up the business in the face of weak sales.

Falling sales in China and heavy discounting in the US, its two biggest markets, have taken a heavy toll on earnings, while a proposed merger with Honda and Mitsubishi collapsed in February.

The latest cutbacks brings the total number of layoffs announced by the company in the past year to about 20,000, or 15% of its workforce.

It was not immediately clear where the job cuts will be made, or whether Nissan's plant in Sunderland will be affected.

Nissan employs about 133,500 people globally, with about 6,000 workers in Sunderland.

The latest layoffs come on top of 9,000 job cuts Nissan announced in November as part of a cost saving effort that it said would reduce its global production by a fifth.

In February, talks between Nissan and its larger rival Honda collapsed after the firms failed to agree on a multi-billion-dollar tie-up.

The plan had been to combine their businesses to fight back against competition from rival firms, especially in China.

The merger would have created a $60bn (£46bn) motor industry giant, the fourth largest in the world by vehicle sales after Toyota, Volkswagen and Hyundai.

After the failure of the negotiations, then-chief executive Makoto Uchida was replaced by Ivan Espinosa, who was the company's chief planning officer and head of its motorsports division.

Nissan also reported an annual loss of 670 billion yen ($4.5bn; £3.4bn), with US President Donald Trump's tariffs putting further pressure on the struggling firm.

Mr Espinosa said that the previous financial year had been ""challenging"", with rising costs and an ""uncertain environment"", adding that the results were a ""wake-up call"".",2025-05-13T09:30:00Z
Belgian soldiers injured in training 'shooting incident',"Three Belgian soldiers have been injured in a shooting incident during a military training exercise in Scotland.

Belgium's defence ministry said approximately 10 other soldiers also sustained hearing damage during the incident.

The defence ministry declined to say where in Scotland the incident took place, but last week it was reported around 600 Belgian armed forces personnel were in Moray for a large-scale operation called Red Condor.

Two of the injured soldiers are now in a stable condition, with one expected to undergo surgery in Scotland before being repatriated to Belgium.

The third soldier who went to hospital sustained minor injuries and has since been discharged.

A spokesman for Belgium's defence ministry said: ""The incident took place during a planned training exercise. An investigation has been launched to determine the exact circumstances.

""The families of the injured personnel have been informed.""

The Belgian prime minister Bart De Wever posted on X that he had been informed that three members of the Third Parachute Battalion had been injured.

He wished them a speedy recovery and  offered his sympathies to their loved ones.",2025-05-13T09:30:00Z
"Trump's order on US drug prices: What's in it, and will it work?","US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order that aims to reduce high prescription drug prices – but its details and long-term effects are far from clear.

Citing figures that patients in other countries pay much less than Americans for pharmaceuticals, Trump said he would order drug companies to reduce their prices inside the US.

He touted the move as ""one of the most consequential"" executive orders in US history, claiming prices would fall ""almost immediately, by 30% to 80%"".

But experts are highly sceptical of the claims, and stock market moves indicate that investors think they will have little immediate effect.

The US has a particularly complex healthcare system - including a large private insurance industry, employer subsides, and publicly funded insurance programmes for the elderly and poor, known as Medicare and Medicaid respectively.

In many other developed countries, more centralised systems mean that officials can negotiate blanket rates for drugs, and in some cases refuse to buy if they deem the price too high.

In 2021, the US Government Accounting Office made a comparison with Australia, Canada and France, and found that prescription drugs were on average two to four times more expensive in the US.

Politicians from both US political parties have taken aim at the costs. During Monday's White House announcement, Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr noted that prices had been a preoccupation of Democrats and a main target in socialist Senator Bernie Sanders' presidential campaigns.

Both Trump in his first term and former President Joe Biden tried to tackle the issue, particularly the cost of life-saving drugs such as insulin, but US prices remain stubbornly high.

Speaking at the White House on Monday, Trump and his health officials blamed the lack of progress on pharmaceutical lobbying efforts and large donations to members of Congress.

""The drug lobby is the strongest lobby,"" Trump told reporters. ""But starting today, the United States will no longer subsidise the health care of foreign countries, which is what we were doing.""

It should also be noted that Trump's trade tariffs – which he has consistently used to threaten other countries - could increase costs even further. Trump has previously said he will tax drugs imported into the US.

Trump's order is much wider than previous efforts to bring down costs - however, many details are yet to be worked out.

The wording directs US officials to make sure that deals over drug costs made by foreign countries do not result in ""unreasonable or discriminatory"" price hikes for Americans.

But what exactly is covered by those terms is unclear – as is the question of what measures the White House would take if ""unreasonable"" practices are discovered.

The White House also wants drug companies to sell more products directly to consumers - cutting out insurance companies and pharmaceutical benefit managers - and look into importing drugs from foreign countries where they are sold at lower prices. That idea has previously hit stumbling blocks over safety and trade rules.

An official said that Monday's order was the start of negotiations between the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and industry.



The order also proposed that the US be given Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status – meaning drug companies would be asked to match the lowest price for a drug abroad when selling to US consumers.

""Big pharma will either abide by this principle voluntarily or we'll use the power of the federal government to ensure that we are paying the same price as other countries,"" Trump told reporters.

It was unclear what mechanism the White House would use to punish drug companies that refuse to voluntarily comply.

Drug prices are very opaque, according to Alan Sager, a professor of health policy at Boston University. Drug manufacturers could easily argue that they were complying with the order by touting the price discounts that they already routinely provide on very high listed retail prices, he told the BBC.

""Will they act? Maybe. Will they claim they act? Sure,"" Prof Sager said.

""Whether this will signal a durable and meaningful cut in extraordinarily high US drug prices is very unclear,"" he said. ""This is rhetoric, not reality.""



Trump's preview of the announcement hit share prices of major drug makers, such as Pfizer, Eli Lilly and the UK's GSK.

But they staged a quick recovery, rallying after the administration shared the scope of its plans – an indication that investors do not expect the moves to have a major impact.

To try to retain their profits in the US, drugs companies could simply pull out of other nations in which they are selling their products more cheaply, according to researchers Darius Lakdawalla and Dana Goldman at the University of Southern California.

The researchers also said that foreign governments routinely underestimated the true value of drugs to patients, and that ""shifting to a European pricing model in the US would lead to shorter, less healthy lives for Americans"".

Meanwhile, it is unclear how lower prescription drug prices would fit into Kennedy's ""Make America Healthy Again"" agenda. The health secretary has consistently emphasised diet and exercise as the key to improving Americans' health – and has criticised the proliferation of many pharmaceutical products, including vaccines and drugs to treat mental illness.

However, any potential reduction in drug prices is likely to be popular with Americans - as polls consistently show that high costs are a top concern when it comes to the US healthcare system.

C Michael White, a pharmacy professor at the University of Connecticut, said that the results of the Trump administration's actions on drug prices ""will be minimal for many Americans"" but that any attempts towards greater transparency and lower costs ""are a positive step in the right direction"".

But the order is expected to face challenges from the pharmaceutical industry in courts and Congress.

Industry groups are largely opposed to the executive order and say it will be counterproductive – potentially choking off the supply of drugs and funds for research while doing little to quell high costs.

Stephen J Ubl, president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said in a statement that ""importing foreign prices from socialist countries would be a bad deal"" for American patients.

John F Crowley, president of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization, called MFN status ""a deeply flawed proposal that would devastate our nation's small- and mid-size biotech companies"" by potentially choking off funding for research.

""Patients and families are not a bargaining chip in a trade war, but that's exactly how they are being treated – first through proposed tariffs on our nation's medicines, now with foreign reference pricing in the name of fairness.""

But Alan Sager, the Boston University professor, was sceptical about the industry's arguments. He pointed out that the money used to research a drug was spent before any profits were made, and suggested that there might be other ways to fund research - such as large cash prizes for cures for specific diseases.

Prof Sager suggested that real action to drive down drug prices would depend on the president's attention span.

""Given the president's apparent public vacillation on many topics, it just isn't clear that he'll stay with this problem or that he'll be willing and able to act effectively,"" he said.

Liberal Party names first female leader after historic Australia election loss,"Australia's Liberal Party has for the first time chosen a woman as its leader, with Sussan Ley to take over from Peter Dutton after he led the party to a bruising election loss.

Ley, from the moderate faction of the party, beat Angus Taylor - who ran on a promise to restore conservative values - by four votes.

At the election on 3 May, the Liberal-National coalition, currently Australia's main opposition party, suffered what many are calling the worst defeat in its history.

Pundits and MPs have blamed the result on polarising leaders, a messy campaign and ""Trumpian"" policies, which alienated women and young people in particular.

Ley's appointment comes as Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was sworn in at Government House on Tuesday, following his Labor Party's landslide election win.

According to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Labor has won at least 93 seats - increasing their majority by 16 - while the Coalition has 42 electorates, down from 58. Some seats are still too close to call.

Ley has held the massive regional New South Wales seat of Farrer since 2001 and has served as a senior minister in a variety of portfolios - making her one of the Liberal Party's most experienced hands. She was also the party deputy under Dutton.

Ted O'Brien, a Queensland MP who was the energy spokesman in charge of selling the coalition's controversial nuclear power proposal, was elected Ley's deputy.

Ley said she wanted to help the party rebuild its relationship with Australians - particularly the women and young people who felt they'd been neglected.

""We have to have a Liberal Party that respects modern Australia, that reflects modern Australia, and that represents modern Australia. And we have to meet the people where they are,"" she said.

She told reporters the party's loss would be subject to a review - as would all of its policies, including its position on nuclear and its net zero emissions goal.

""I want to do things differently, and we have to have a fresh approach,"" she said.

""I committed to my colleagues that there would be no captain's calls from anywhere by me... that we would work through every single policy issue and canvas the different views and take the time to get it right.""

In a statement after the leadership vote, unsuccessful contender Taylor congratulated Ley and called for unity.

""Sussan has led a remarkable life and becoming the first woman to lead the Liberal Party is a milestone for Sussan and our party,"" he said.

The junior coalition partner, the Nationals, re-elected leader David Littleproud on Monday, after he too was challenged by a hardline conservative colleague.

Albanese's new cabinet was also sworn in on Tuesday.

The biggest changes include former Labor deputy Tanya Plibersek swapping from the environment portfolio to social services, and former communications minister Michelle Rowland becoming attorney general.

Former Attorney General Mark Dreyfus and Ed Husic - the first Muslim to become an Australian government minister - were both removed from the frontbench.

""I have got people who are, I think, in the best positions and that's across the board,"" Albanese said when announcing the positions on Monday.

Born in Nigeria to English parents, Ley grew up in the United Arab Emirates before moving to Australia at age 13.

""Travelling, and being at boarding school on my own, I think you either sink or swim,"" Ley said in a previous interview. ""Obviously, I was someone who decided very early on in life that I wasn't going to sink.""

It was as a young woman that she changed her name from Susan to Sussan, inspired by numerology - an ancient belief that numbers have a mystical impact on people's lives.

""I read about this numerology theory that if you add the numbers that match the letters in your name you can change your personality,"" she told The Australian.

""I worked out that if you added an 's' I would have an incredibly exciting, interesting life and nothing would ever be boring. It's that simple.""

""And once I'd added the 's' it was really hard to take it away.""

As an adult she has had a ""wonderfully varied"" career path, Ley says, obtaining degrees in economics and accounting while raising three young children, earning a commercial pilot licence, and working in the outback mustering livestock.

Elected in 2001 to represent an area the size of New Zealand, Ley was promoted to Health Minister under Malcom Turnbull in 2014, but resigned two years later amid an expenses scandal.

Ley apologised after using a taxpayer-funded trip to purchase an apartment on Queensland's Gold Coast.

She re-joined the frontbench in 2019 after Scott Morrison's ""miracle"" election win, as the Minister for Environment.

In that role, she was taken to court by a group who claimed she had a duty of care towards children to protect them from harm caused by climate change. Eight teenagers and an 87-year-old nun convinced a court that the government had a legal duty towards them when assessing fossil fuel projects, but the landmark decision was later overturned.

Ley has also drawn headlines for her comments about Palestinians. She was a co-chair of the Parliamentary Friends of Palestine, an informal cross-party group which aimed to raise the experiences of Palestinian people and has spoken in the chamber in support of Palestinian autonomy.

However, speaking after the vote on Tuesday, one of her colleagues Andrew Wallace said she has ""seen the light on Israel in recent years"".",2025-05-13T09:30:00Z
Driver jailed for murdering biker who did wheelie,"A driver who chased and murdered a biker by deliberately ramming him with his car after seeing him do a wheelie has been jailed for life.

Abdirahman Ibrahim, 21, ""weaponised"" his Seat Leon and twice drove into Liam Jones, 22, as he rode his e-motorbike in Sheldon, Birmingham, on 1 August 2023, Birmingham Crown Court had heard.

Ibrahim remained emotionless in the dock as he was handed a life sentence with a minimum term of 22 years on Monday.

After he was convicted in February, police said they believed he was motivated to ram Mr Jones after seeing him showboat and wanted to ""teach him a lesson"".

Mr Jones crashed into a bollard and died at the scene from his injuries.

At the crown court on Monday, Judge Andrew Smith KC said it must have been clear to Ibrahim that Mr Jones was not wearing a helmet while riding his e-motorbike on Moat Lane.

""After careful reflection I have concluded that you did drive the car into and on Moat Lane such that you had the car available as a weapon,"" he said.

The judge said Ibrahim, of Bonham Grove, Yardley, had pursued Mr Jones and his friend in a ""determined and deliberate way"".

He said Mr Jones, who was described as the fun and bubbly ""spark"" of his family, had done nothing to prompt Ibrahim to chase him.

The court heard Ibrahim had become aware of friends Mr Jones and Tayzhon Johnson as he entered Coventry Road and changed direction to follow them.

The judge said the two men realised they were being followed and went down a one-way street to get away from the car, but Ibrahim drove at speed along another nearby road to catch them.

""There is no evidence that Mr Jones or Mr Johnson ever participated in racing with your car or did anything to encourage you to interact with them,"" the judge told Ibrahim.

CCTV footage showed the car close behind Mr Jones, who was performing a ""stand-up wheelie"".

The driver kept pursuing the riders and drove into Mr Jones twice on Moat Lane, shortly before midnight.

Police had said he then drove away and parked his car in another neighbourhood, while his brother called for a taxi to take them home.

The judge added: ""Your actions in the immediate aftermath of this deliberate collision were governed by a selfish desire to escape from the scene and involved no care for Mr Jones,"" he said.

Ibrahim's brother, Abdullahi Ibrahim, 22, also of Bonham Grove, pleaded guilty to assisting an offender at an earlier hearing and was jailed for two years and 10 months on Monday.

The court heard he was a rear seat passenger in the Seat and was involved in efforts to hide the vehicle in the hours after the murder.
